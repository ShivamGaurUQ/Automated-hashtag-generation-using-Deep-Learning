 bug out for blood the other night  i left the patio door open just long enough to let in a dozen bugs of various size  i didnt notice them until the middle of the night  when i saw them clinging to the ceiling  since im such a bugaphobe  i grabbed the closest object within reach  and with a rolled up comic book i smote mine enemies and smeared their greasy bug guts  all except for the biggest one   i only clipped that one  taking off one of its limbs  so now theres a five limbed insect lurking in the apartment  no doubt looking for some vengeance against me  im looking around corners  checking the toilet before sitting down  wondering when its going to jump out  all this  and the cicadas havent even arrived yet  a few years ago  a young man died out on my front lawn when he crashed his motorbike  i was with him in his last moments but there was nothing i could do because he was badly injured with a broken neck  later  when i was visiting the place where he died  i decided to talk to him as if he were still there because i wanted him to know how bad i felt that i couldnt help him  and i know this sounds crazy  but i saw this ball of light in the trees above me  at first  my logical mind thought that it was my brother playing around with his new flashlight  not at all like it  but the closest thing i could imagine  and when i went inside the house  everyone was snoring  lol could this have been what they call an orb ps  not the first weird experience ive had  today when i arrived at my community garden plot  it actually looked like a garden  not a weedy mess with maybe some stuff growing in it if you know where to look  we had hit the typical mid summer mess of fast growing weeds and no time to do anything about it  plus all the rain had made a huge swamp and it was hard to get a moment to work when it wasnt actively pouring  i put in a bunch of time this past week  and its paying off   along with free standing non weed choked plants  i have now re planted three of the beds with salad greens  spinach  and chard  and while the viability of the seeds was questionable  i accidentally unearthed some from the bed i planted   days ago and they had already started to sprout   this marks the first time i have reclaimed the garden from a weed problem and turned it back into a productive garden  other years ive never managed to get the late summer planting done   i wouldve liked to get salad greens in   weeks ago  to harvest baby greens for salads along the way  but im still pretty pleased   ive also got a few ideas for improving the garden next year  for one thing  the radishes fall down all over the place and make a mess when they go to seed  and they really could be removed once flea beetle season has passed  which i didnt think to do this year  theyre attracting cool butterflies  but i might be able to do that with some less floppy flowers  we pulled up all the summer plants today  before we pulled up plants we picked   eggplants  a few tomatoes and a distressing amount of peppers  have i mentioned that we have a bunch of peppers we have some friends who want another bottle of our habanero chili oil  we bought one of those metal cans of olive oil yesterday so there will be a bunch of oil made this year  after tilling the garden over  we planted    broccoli and    cabbage plants  then using seed  we planted a half row of mustard  a half row of radish  a full row of turnip  a full row of kale and a full row of spinach  i can hardly wait until the end of october to see whats going to be a viable harvest  were betting that we have at least into the first week of november before it gets too cold for plants  we have plenty of seed left and so were planning on planting again in march april  i had no idea how beautiful mustard seeds are a rainbow of colors  while the better half ran the tiller  i moved some nandina to  hopefully  better spots  in the place of the nandina  i planted some grasses we had in pots around the pool  i hope all of those plants survive the winter  its amazing to me how the soil in our front yard varies between being pretty rich looking to being utter crap  it is nice to realize how the vegetable garden soil has really come along since we first planted a garden there three years ago  at some point well have to go into the jungle portion of our vegetable garden and clear out all the weeds from the strawberry and asparagus  at this point  its a huge mess but thats a chore for another day  i have two cats  i always felt like i was a dog person  but we decided to get a kitty because they are more low maintenance than dogs   we went to a no kill shelter to get our first cat  i wanted a little kitty  but the only baby kitten they had scratched the crap out of me the minute i picked it up  so  that was a big  no   they had what they called  teenagers   they were cats that were     months old  not adults  but a little bigger than the little kittens  one stood out   mostly because she jumped up on a shelf behind my husband and smacked him in the head with her paw  we had a winner   i had no idea how much personality a cat can have  our first kitty loves to play  she will play until she is out of breath  then  she looks at you as if to say   just give me a minute  ill get my breath back and be good to go   sometimes i wish i had that much enthusiasm for anything in my life  she loves to chase a string  its the best thing ever  ok  maybe it runs a close second to hair scrunchies  we play fetch with my hair scrunchies  i throw them down the stairs and she runs  top speed  to get them and bring them back  again  she will do this until she is out of breath   if only i could work out that hardid probably be thinner  just after new years in      we went and adopted charlie  our best cat friend  he was   months old at the time  and still trying to figure out how he ended up in a clear plastic cage  recently fgirl plurked that she was adopting a kitty  which got me thinking about the whole adoption process we went through   many people go directly to breeders or pet stores when they want a pet  but you may want to consider a shelter first   when we were thinking about getting a cat we decided to check one of the local animal shelters here in rochester  lollypop farms  i had volunteered at lollypop as part of my universitys freshman orientation  and loved the place  they have two locations  a main one in fairport  ny and a secondary location at a local petsmart  we went to the petsmart first  and were lucky to find charlie  then named titan  on the first visit   we got to the store and went to the lollypop animal section  there were only a few cats     or so  but one stood out immediately  charlie was the only white cat there  and when we went to look at him he licked us through the cage  john asked if he could hold him  and immediately charlie was a ball of love  we thought about going to other shelters to compare animals  but then another woman came in and wanted to adopt charlie  too  we didnt want to lose him  so decided  rather spur of the moment  to adopt him right there  it was the best decision weve made in a long time   sometimes animals at shelters seem to understand that you are rescuing them from an unfortunate situation  and they respond to that   if you are going to adopt an animal consider using petfinder to find local shelters near you  they are usually a lot less expensive  have had all reproductive procedures and vaccinations already completed at no charge  and most of the time have a large variety of animals  all looking for a new family   charlie loves to hide and play attack games  he doesnt quite understand that if he can see us  we can probably see him  the protesters apparently started their protest at the capitol building then moved to downtown  we happened to be standing at the corner of   th and stout when somebody said that the police were getting ready to tear gas a group of demonstrators  we looked around the corner and there were police everywhere  they had blockaded the whole street  and shut down the light rail  it turned out there were about     protesters who were demonstrating in the streets  supposedly  the goal of the protesters was to block streets and traffic  the protesters were demonstrating primarily against the iraq war and more generally against corporate power  which  in their minds  inflicts both political parties  the police got after them to move  and about half of them went into a parking garage  the police sealed the garage and went in after them  it was shocking to see the number of police involved  they easily out numbered the protesters by about       the protesters were mostly in their late teens and early twenties  the police contingent included swat teams  riot teams  and police on horses  the organization of security is different than in boston  in boston  there were many law enforcement personnel throughout the convention area  but they tended to be more spread out  when we walked out of our hotel this afternoon  the first thing we saw was a swat team outside the hotel  in full riot control gear  we saw several such teams in the two block walk to the   th street mall  there were vehicles loaded with about       police patrolling through the streets  entire groups of police nearly everywhere you looked  frankly  it seemed a bit of an over reaction  on the other hand  its clear that any attempt to block traffic will not be allowed  which is quite understandable  i didnt see the police do anything really out of line  in fact  they seemed thoroughly professional  still  it was a bit abrupt to see three companies of police actually marching through the streets of denver  weve seriously had some crazy weather these past couple of days it was nonstop rain  and more rain  supposedly yesterday was the rainiest day in recorded chicago history  we got a tiny amount of water in our basement  which is nothing compared to what most people are dealing with  the rain finally let up early this afternoon  and john and i went driving around and were stunned by all the flooding in our neighborhood  ive never seen anything like it  we tried to go see a movie  but couldnt get to the movie theatre because all the surrounding roads were flooded and closed off  at one point we saw about    deer in a clearing near a forest preserve  and i saw a bunch more deer down the road  when i looked into the forest  i could see how flooded and murky it was  the poor deer have nowhere to go  i feel so bad for them  john would not let me bring any of them home with us yes  i wanted to  my dad told me that coyotes are traveling around the city in packs in broad daylight  looking for food  so watch out  this is complete craziness  well  i decided to name the bunny devi  boy  shes a nibbler  i think shes still getting used to us  but i was glad to notice her eating and drinking  we didnt see her eat her pellets or drink from her bottle last night  though she did take a chunk out of her treat   i got her an igloo to hide in  in case we get to be too much for her at times  she seems to like it  ill have to get video of it sometime  but john just loves petting devi  he  also  likes looking at her through the cage  as long as we let him stand there and touch the cage  one of us will lay down with devi on our chest  and john will sit on our stomach behind her and pet her  he gets so excited and laughs a lot  we do have to keep an eye on him because he likes to try to pick her up or grab her ears sometimes  were still trying to teach him to be gentle  he does pretty well with it most of the time  not much else going on  just thought i would share with you one of my most embarassing moments as a teacher to date  ten years ago i was teaching a mixed class of  th graders esl  i had taken the register and was standing at the front of the class doing some revision however  all eyes were not on my face but at my ankles  nervously i looked down to see that my underslip had somehow made its way to the floor  elastic gone what to do so i looked at my underwear round my ankles  looked at the class  looked back at the garment  carefully stepped out of it  said   oh dear look  what on earth can that be   lifted the offending white  not red and black thank the lord  slip and casually popped it in the bottom drawer of my desk  i continued   ok class  page      no one  strangely  batted an eyelid  later that day i wondered how they had described the day to their parents over dinner   so john  what did you do in school today   we looked at the teachers underwear   woohoo   so excited about my new range i ordered a few days ago  seriously  i can hardly wait  a couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven range  the oven malfunctioned it was supposed to be baking at     degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames  he tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading  i ran and got a fire extinguisher  he opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling    luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast  nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were      back to normal  since then we have been using a plug in burner  griddle  and counter top oven  not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing   cant wait to have a real range again  this is one of those times i wish i had a digital camera  we keep a large stainless steel bowl of water outside on the back deck for benjamin to drink out of when hes playing outside  his bowl has become a very popular site  throughout the day  many birds drink out of it and bathe in it  the birds literally line up on the railing and wait their turn  squirrels also come to drink out of it  the craziest squirrel just came by  he was literally jumping in fright at what i believe was his own reflection in the bowl  he was startled so much at one point that he leap in the air and fell off the deck  but not quite  i saw his one little paw hanging on  after a moment or two his paw slipped and he tumbled down a few feet  but oh  if you could have seen the look on his startled face and how he jumped back each time he caught his reflection in the bowl  even if were on vacation  potty re learning goes on  theres not much success yet  or must i say  no success yet  he still wont sit on the toilet and do his thing  though he wants me to dump his poopie in the toilet  and insists that he flushes the toilet on his own  however yesterday was a different story  i was watching nicktoons  and the little boy was hiding in the closet playing  when he bursted out crying for help  and it went like this mommy  please help  with clasp hands on his chest  pleading  my almost  yo is really funny and cute  sometimes  i dont find him funny and cute when he pesters me  so i dashed him to the bathroom with no resistance  but as usual  it was too late  he did it on his nappy  and it was mushy  since hes back taking antibiotics  oh  not again    which the hotel doctor prescribed him late monday night  due to wheezing  that we can hear everytime he breaths  he hasnt pooped yet today  so well see if i could time it properly  meaning  poopie in the big potty  board prayer and healing author   we found out on friday that our    year old puppy has kidney failure  too extensive to do anything about it  sudden  in that it was not noticed at her vet visit in june  she had a wonderful saturday walking her favorite  nearby home  letterboxing spots  but  monday am she began to crash and she is now too weak to eat or get up  we are terribly sad and feeling more so because we just learned about it friday  we are a bit in shock  i know she is only a dog as many would say  but  she is a beloved member of our family  and  her    year old owner had to leave her this morning to go back to college  so  she is hours away as we spend our last few hours with our puppy baby  so  prayers for soon relief for daffnee  and peace and healing for the family who loves her very much  thanks folks  what happened today yeah  i had to put it down somewhere to remember this  basically  jane reversed her car and bumped into the car behind us  we drove away because i checked and there wasnt anything there  i thought maybe we hit something else  then we went to chevron and she checked  there was a tiny scratch  i didnt notice because her car isnt exactly new  but yeah  theres a scratch  so she goes dude lets color it in with markers  so then she actually goes in her car and pulls out a red marker and starts coloring  okay it doesnt sound as funny on here  but if you were there  it was freaking hilarous  it looked like she was psycho cloring a car with crayola markers  anyways  it worked haha then we went to barcode  the end  oh and the guy that was casher ing us was pretty cute  he looked familiar  last week this commonwealth bank atm on swanston was spitting out    dolla notes instead of   s  me and about a million others thought we had finally hit the jackpot and finally the little man was getting one up on the man  i took out     bucks which turned into like      or some shit i was so happy so very happy  it came round to friday this week and i thought id got away with this shit and could pay my credit card off and buy awesome shit then i tried to get    bucks out and my account was     bucks overdrawn  the fuckers    they took it back  it was their fault  there must be alot of sad sonsabitches like me around this weekend  luckily i didnt spend it all but still pretty devo  a drunk john and i took some photos that splendid nite when we got home however and i will at least have that  for one night i felt like a total baller  enjoy the majesty that is cc and the stolen fiddys i get photographed alot on the floor lately  cc  my most recent strangely happy moment  i was in a car accident the other day  sort of  heheh  i was heading to janes b day party  mixed with her brothers  theyre all born in the same month  and this girl anne hits me when im about to hit the stoplight coming off an exit  i get out of my car  shes spazzing  i checked my bumper where she hit me  scraped up  shes spazzing  i see her license plate frame broke off  picked it up and handed it to her  shes spazzing still asking if we should trade information  if im okay  apologizing so what else could i do i gave her a hug and told her it was okay  she spazzed less  it made me indescribably happy  not the accident but the easing of her spazzing  the hug really did wonders  it was cool that i knew her too  she works at this the edge kiosk in the trumbull and milford malls  shes a cutey  just a random happy moment for me  getting hit by another car  grins  le poof  before i had children  i worried about my incredibly foul mouth  would my kids start cursing like little toddling sailors this was a bit silly given that my family cursed like mad when i was a kid  but i did not  because i knew i would get in trouble  so its clearly possible  on the other hand  my sister was nearly expelled from quaker pre school for calling someone a shithead at age    but then i realized that i could control my cursing if i were in some professional situation  or eating with my wonderful in laws  or what have you  and i just had to transfer that attitude to my kids  i was justly proud when i dropped a big bottle of soda on my bare foot in the elevator at gillman and shouted oh  crumbles    but i knew yesterday that i had really done a better job than i imagined our  stray  semi adopted  cat took a dump right on my bed yesterday because it was    and we had been out of cat food all day  i groaned and when ann asked why i said hissfahan shit on the bed  and she said whats shit that was one hell of a storm  the biggest to hit baton rouge  the entire city was out of power the first few days  and it took seven days for power to be restored in my neighborhood  the damage was widespread across baton rouge  the wind had mangled store fronts and signs  and knocked over trees crushing houses and damaging power lines  a curfew has been in place most of the week upon threat of arrest  blackhawk  chinook  news  police  and coast guard helicopters could be seen or heard in the skies hourly  the national guard came in huge convoys on the interstate and set up distribution centers for ice  tarps  and mres  luckily we had prepared with enough food to last us the week  and enough gas to run the generator for a few days  it took days more for the gas stations and stores to start opening again  and several hour long lines would form outside  we ended up driving an hour out of town just to restock on supplies things are almost back to normal now  only about        of the city is left without power and most of the stores and gas stations are back online  through tv and radio we were kept up to date on local news  but as far as national news ive lived in a virtual black hole  my power was restored last night and its going to take awhile to get things rolling again  school has started today  and they want to take away some of our saturdays for make up classes  and if that werent bad enough  hurricane ike is on the horizon and could just as well hit us again  causing more power and scheduling problems  keep your eyes peeled the next couple of days for some photos i took of the damage  i am new here so i dont know if this has been posted but me and my father bought iphone  gs then two weeks later he went swimming with his  so he wanted to get another one but didnt want to pay the       so we went to at t and we told them what happened and they said with an iphone you are always eligable for an upgrade and you can get a new iphone at the same price but you just have to restart your  yr agreement  since we only had the phones for  weeks restarting the  yrs was nothing  so we went to the apple store and told them we had water damage they said we need a new phone  so we went like we were getting a phone and we got a new phone for the same     and restarted our contract  then sold the water damged one for     on ebay  i got pulled over this morning   err yesterday morning on my way back to owings mills for my sorority retreat deal  yeah  totally didnt notice the cops like i usually do  and apparently flew past him doing     and i didnt slow down when i got to      they really need to up the speed limit to    over there i swear   so he asked me what my excuse was  i dont have one sir  license and registration please  i sit there  waiting for the ticket  he hands me everything back and says slow down  thats way too fast  have a good day   you too officer  yeah  so never going over    on     ever again  cruise control buddy how you doin told mom and dad i was doing    in a    they said if i get a ticket  ill more than likely not have car insurance  gah  either way  no more than    above  doing the speed limit on the highways around here is dangerous man  people almost hit me like  three times on      i met this boy sunday and we hung out all day and did a lot of flirting  then we started texting and were texting for like    hours straight saying flirty things and having fun messing with each other  i fell for him the second i saw him  and then when i got to know him i was head over heals  then i found out he had he had a girl friend the whole time  he never told me  i dont know how to cope  i dont know what to do at all  how could he have lead me on like that i was so hurt  and i just felt like an idiot  i know i need to tell him but i cant  and i really want to stay friends with him and maybe it will lead to something else  but i dont know if i can trust him  im so lost and i need advice  or help or any kind words of encouragement  what one thing have you done in your life that you are you most ashamed of when my son was   months old  i was changing him on his rather high changing table  that we had been given as a gift   i heard someone approaching from behind me so i turned for half a second to see who it was  my mil   my son chose that moment to roll over for the very first time in his life  and he rolled right off the table  he landed head first on a solid marble floor  it was so quick  i still to this day dont know how he did it  he fractured his tiny skull and had some brain bruising  i have never forgiven myself and i know i never will  thankfully there was no lasting damage    we went back for follow up tests a month later and everything was back to normal in regards to his brain activity  over two years later  he is highly advanced for his age  but that doesnt stop me from looking back at that day and wanting to die of guilt  shame  and self hatred  the scariest thing happened to me this morning  i was all ready to go to school  amp  eating my breakfast when i got this really weird feeling and it felt like my heart was skipping beats  i couldnt move or anything  like my whole body was paralyzed  then it hurt so bad  i started freaking out to the point where i wanted to go to the hospital  atfirst i thought it was just a panic attack but then i was like  uhh thats never happened when im having one before  so i stayed home and went to the doctors at     ive been through this before but it just felt like my heart skipped  it never hurt  so i got blood taken and an ekg  on the   th i have to go dupont to get a echo cardiogram and wear a holter monitor for a few days or so  ive done it before so its no big deal  i just love making an ass of myself in public places  theres a really cute barista at the b n cafe  i go there a lot  so he knows my name and what i usually order  i saw he was working  so i grabbed a couple magazines and headed over  all fine and good  right except the magazine on the top of the pile lansing bride  yeah  f you jane  i realized when i set stuff down to pay  and by then there was no going back  and of course he said something  and of course my only reply was to mumble something about a friend getting married  he didnt look convinced  so  now im the weird chick who sits in b n reading wedding magazines when shes not even getting married  or  im the chick who lies about getting married so she can hit on the baristas  yay  also  i really hate libertarians  they suck  i had a dream last night  or perhaps this morning  since i kept waking up to my alarm and resetting it for a few minutes more sleep  i was running through a field of grass  carrying an armful of what i think were papers  i was running away  i was fed up with something  grieved  sad  i cried as i ran  i tossed the papers all away from me and ran faster  but as i ran like this  my crying turned into quiet laughter  then i ran faster still  and my laughing got louder  finally  i was running so fast  faster than i had ever run in my life  and laughing so hard  harder than i had ever laughed  that i tumbled into the grass onto my back  i stared up into the clear sky and laughed until my sides were sore  then i breathed a long  happy sigh and continued to look into the sky  that was it  weve passed this irrigation canal  for the watering of the fields  many years and many seasons  yesterday  the canal caught my eye in the gusty rain  the colors were deeper  saturated  and the landscape nearly a painting  an ordinary irrigation canal beautiful in the rain  pulled off on the side  no shoulder  of a two lane highway  windshields wipers swishing  traffic splashing by  i was able to capture what i saw  by the way  i wasnt driving this time  dear john managed maneuvering the truck around drop offs and ditches  while watching the traffic  as i focused the camera and clicked with blowing rain through the window  we spent the next few hours trading driving  and snapping photos from within the truck  and truly enjoyed our rainy photographic escapade  we were amazed how the rain brought out the colors  and ordinary things were magical  copyright  c       by    all rights reserved  visit our other photoblog abstract reflections theres a woman in one f my classes who i am very attracted to  lucky for me  she offered to give me a ride home every week  last week she drove me and another student home  but the other guy has a car now i guess  so it was just me and her  she sort of walked right up next to me so our arms were touching as we were walking to her car  but i didnt make a move then  and right before she dropped me off at my house she mentioned she has a boyfriend  so i didnt make a move on her  does this mean i had my chance and missed it  or that i said something stupid in the car and she isnt attracted to me any more there was nothing awkward about our goodbye  i just didnt make a move because she mentioned her boyfriend  or do you think she still wants to hook up  and she just mentioned her boyfriend to let me know that it will only be sexual  and she is not looking to get involved in a relationship with me bob searched around his bag for his keys  quickly finding what he was looking for and turning the lock to open his door  he crept inside  feeling like he was going to get in trouble by some force for doing what hed been doing the last few weeks  he removed his shoes  dropping his bag on the sofa  and walked into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea  he numbly moved about the kitchen  trying to keep all the late nights  the moans  the bruising touches out of his mind  without looking up  he raised his hand to get a mug out of the cupboard  but hit his hand hard on that same stupid fucking pan that always hung precariously just underneath it  he cursed  pulling his hand back to cradle it against his chest  angry tears threatened to spill from his eyes as everything came crashing back  instead of holding them back  he sank to the floor against the counter  holding his head in his hands  and sobbed  no longer caring who heard or what they thought  ok  i never noticed this but like   weeks ago my dad bought this powdered chocolate that you put into a drink  he and i put it with ice and fruits for a smoothie instead  and what he says makes your muscles bigger i didnt believe him and i dont think anything that is legal could make your muscles bigger cause when i read the bottle it said all this scientific nosense that i had no clue about  well  ive been taking the poweder  in a smoothie of course  for about   weeks now and while im not buldging huge ive noticed i have grown reasonably bigger in my chest and arms areas  biceps and triceps   but then again i do workout almost every other day  its not that often  he said take the drink every day and only   scoop of powder per day or youll get kidney problems with more than one scoop  also this is a serious topic  if your willing to help and answer my question please post  and be honest  i am a palestinian journalist from gaza  at the age of     i armed myself with a camera and a pen  committed to report accurately on events in gaza  i have filed reports as israeli fighter jets bombed gaza city i have been recognized for my reporting  even in the united states and united kingdom  where i have won two international awards  i have also been beaten and tortured by israeli soldiers dutch mp hans van baalen lobbied the israeli government to let me leave gaza to receive my award in person  upon my return from london  i was surrounded by israeli security officers  i was stripped naked at gunpoint  interrogated  kicked and beaten for more than four hours  at one point i fainted and then awakened to fingernails gouging at the flesh beneath my eyes they dragged me by my feet  sweeping my head through my own vomit  i lost consciousness  i was told later that they transferred me to a hospital only when they thought i might die          ok so i was leaving walmart fun fun  guess who drives by me hmm any takers no fine my ex  my heart jumped then i turned the car around and went back into walmart  yes im a freak  yes i guess you could say im a stalker but i just wanted to see his reaction when he saw me  i dont know why i wanted to tell him off in the worst way  i just wanted to do something  in the end i just played it cool  talked to him for like    seconds  and then left  now i wish i never did that  because really  now i am still left with everything i wish i had the guts to say  now i wish i had balls enough to truly tell him off and let him know what a complete piece of shit he really is but in the end i guess i know im better than that  in fact better than him  if i hadnt said it before  i will say it now hes a loser  but really  even knowing that doesnt make it much easier  i first saw my wife in the aafes  army   air force exchange service  snack bar  more than    years ago  she was with an army buddy so so friend of mine ill call him love boats capt  john and his korean wife mrs john   it seems the future mrs bob  ill call her ann  was best friends with his wife  the korean version of mrs john   well  like my uncle bob would do  i just walked right over there  said hi  and i sat right smack down at their table  why was i so bold the answer is easy  my future wife  ann  was beautiful  within about   minute i had offered her everything and anything in the snackbar  including salt   pepper shakers  silverware  tables and chairs  she thought i was either a cute nut or just nuts  i was in love  it was love at first sight and i was like an ernest t  bass from the andy griffith show  i soo felt like  i gotta get a date with that beautiful girl  we said goodbye and i drooled my way back to the barracks  today was a very eventful work day  today was the start of the g   summit  it happens every year and it is where    of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their governments effectively and what not  since there are so many leaders coming together their are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest  there was a protest that happened along the street where i work and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot  police cars were burned and things were thrown at cops  police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence  as things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters while they smash windows of stores  and this all happened right in front of my store which was kind of scary but it was kind of interesting since ive never seen a riot before  two years ago  my division got a new director  at the same time  we  my division  were submitting a contract to do some work for a big company  when we were awarded the contract  the new director began communicating with the organization  the contracting organization required everyone who was to work on the project to sign a contract of non disclosure  the new director sent out an email noting the urgency of everyone signing  scanning  and formatting the signed and scanned contract into a pdf  he noted that it had to be done that very day  a friday   i had no problem with this  as it was very important   on wednesday of the following week  he sent me and a few other people an email stating that he had just gotten around to looking at the contracts and needed something else  the fact that he said he must receive them by friday but did not look at them for another   days infuriated me  i went directly to his office and told him that if he was going to express dire urgency  then the situation had better be urgent  i told him that he wasted my time  and everyone elses   i told him that was unacceptable and that i did not expect for that to ever happen again  he did nothing but sit in his chair and say okay  needless to say  his general laziness and inattentiveness resulted in his quick termination  now  on with this weeks story the last month has been hectic  turbo charged  lots of work because i was learning from tim  my partner in crime  this hasnt been helped by the intense pressure in town due to the political transition coming to an end  this week things started alright and on schedule  but i managed to get myself arrested by the traffic police  rouleage  early last wednesday  after yelling excessively at their outright corrupted methods and asking incessently for what law i actually broke  they managed to bring me in at the police hq  i was drawing too much of a curious crowd for the authorities  in about half an hour at police hq i had charmed every one around  i had prepared my  gift  as they wished  decision witheld  they decided that i neednt to bother  they liked me too much  i should go free  i even managed to meet famous raus  the big chief  he was too happy to let me go when he realized i was no one  but then  a major at his side noticed my visa was expired  damn  my current visa is being renewed in my other passport at immigrations  f  in custody  for real  the best part at this moment in time i didnt have ma phone  no contact with the exterior  so they decided i should write a letter to who ever was taking care of my visa  a policeman turned mailman was sent off on foot  an hour later  things started sorting out  worried people started to find out where i was  now an experienced suspect  i had yielded off attempts by several  but not most  policemen of all sorts to bribe my way out  everyone was nice to me  albeit you cant really trust anyones intentions using the following algorithm authority   tiny wage   desperate measures xc    its now noon and my primary activity is killing mosquitoes flying by sitting on white plastic chair in majors office  and wondering why majors computer  the only one in the station i saw  was neither plugged to the wall or to the screen  the little attention he gave to me was reminders not to wear my cap in his presence  back in the principals office  unfortunately  by the afternoon  i was still an illegal alien until proven otherwise  solution arrived at around  pm someone backshished my escape  cost       i was proven innoncent  you know who you are  so thanks a bunch for keeping out for me  with my newly claimed innocence  i had my share of farewells with about a dozen officers  that sure put an end to my turbo speed  at the other end  major  i know youll have a fantastic week end  enjoy it  its your first democratic one    f  d  d ee  a  fa  bb  i know i said in my last entry that i was gonna start dating like a guy  but i started crushin on this guy  at first i thought he liked me back  but then a friend told me that he only liked me as a friend  so i started to back off  then i started noticing how he acted around this other girl  i had a pretty good feeling he liked her  for example he is almost always in her room  he tells her stuff he doesnt really tell anyone else  and he gets real twitchy around her  so naturally i asked him and he said he thought she was pretty  after hearing that i started thinkin i should really back off now  then he asked me who i liked and i didnt want to tell him  later he guess but i never really told him if he was right or not  i was soooo confused as to whether or not these were signs that he liked me  after seeking advice i decided to write him an email telling him i liked him  i know not the best idea   when i look him in the eyes i get extremely nervous and i start to back out so i figured i could be brave in an email  i emailed him last night but havent got a response yet and now hes acting really strange  now i beginning to think i made a major mistake and fucked up any chance i coulda had with him  i know before he told me who he thought i liked that he didnt really want to say because he didnt want there to be any awkwardness  i guess its too late for that huh the new year has begun and it is time for me to get back into the swing of things  but  to begin with  i need to do a little bit of wrapping up as far as      is concerned  last january  after my parents got back to their home in florida  my father called to tell me that my mother was diagnosed with parkinsons disease  i must say that i am still a bit in shock about that  my grandfather  my fathers father  had parkinsons so i have prepared myself to learn of my father being diagnosed with it  nothing personal  dad   but my momthat was a shocker  and very upsetting  they had just left and i wouldnt be seeing her for six long months  that was really hard  not being able to look at my mom  watch her  see if she was okay  after many doctors appointments and tests  mom still has parkinsons but it is apparently in the very early stages  this is good  she is on medication which will help keep the disease in check  and  after finally being able to see her  i am happy to report that she looks great  i dont think anyone would think anything was amiss by looking at her  now my folks are back in florida  mom will be able to see her doctor  which is good  and  shell be back here in six months  which is better  that was the beginning of       on december  nd  my mother  apparently my parents take turns  told me that my brother  john  had called to tell them that he had been diagnosed with stomach cancer  unfortunately it is very advanced and he was told that he has about three months to a year  my brother and i havent had much of a relationship as adults  he has led a different kind of life from me and we have grown apart  i hadnt seen him for almost nine years and the last time i saw him is not something i look back on fondly  he didnt know my boys and barely knew my husband  that being said  he is my little brother and i love him dearly  we were pretty close as kids growing up and i do have lots of wonderful memories of our childhood together  and i always thought that some day we could be brother and sister again  john wanted to come up to michigan  he wanted to be with our parents and me and my family for christmas  we hadnt spent a christmas together  the four of us  for about    years  and we had never been together like this  ever  but we made it happen  john came up with his girlfriend and her daughter  johns son and daughter came up from ohio  even my two step sons joined in on the fun  and it was fun  ill write a post about our christmas later  pictures and all  it was a bit of a shock  seeing my little brother after so long  i found myself looking at him a lot  he actually looked pretty good  a sight for sore eyes  we reconnected right away  picking up where we left off  we talked a little  john and i  about what was happening to him  he didnt want his visit to be about his condition and i respected that so i didnt push  it was a really wonderful time  john and i also said good bye to each other on january first  one of the hardest things i think i have ever experienced  my family and i are planning on going to florida to visit over spring break and john is thinking about coming up again in the summer  in the meantime  im doing a lot of praying  praying that hell be healed  praying for more time  praying for our parents who have to watch this happen to their son  praying for my niece and nephew who have to watch this happen to their dad  and thanking god that i was able to see john  that he could meet his nephews and that we could make some sweet memories  now for       visiting family has departed nathanael is back at school and dave is back at work  asher and i are back to our routines  too  im slowly putting my house back together and making plans for the artwork id like to create this year  i also wanted to get back into blogging  im sorry to start my return with something sad but i felt like i needed to get this down  now i need to move forward  as i get updates about john ill let you know  danielle i have had a time to relax after the wedding  it was a glorious day  it started early  i went to the hairdressers for  am  the girls left at  am for their appointment  my hair was done up in an undo  it was beautiful in my opinion  i scooted over to the shop that our bride and moh  maid of honour  were at  i took a few pics and was blown away by the beauty of my girls  the bride had piercing eyes and a smile as gorgeous as ever  her dark hair was cascading down her shoulders and she looked amazing  the moh had a beautiful blond head of tousled and braided hair  and her eye makeup rivaled cleopatra in stunning beauty  so i went home and hubby and i loaded up the wedding gown and overnight bag  case of water and a crinoline that took up half the car  there was also a bag of shoeswe had to be at the hotel for   am  so off we head  we decide to valet park so we could have the convenience of the front door our car full  we get the bell mans cart and begin to load all on to it  the cart ballooned over and the gown was dragging on the ground   the cart was hard to steer and a few doors and walls seen the side of our dress bag  we made it to the suite  it was a lavish room with an unbelievable view of the detroit river  we settled into the room and shortly after that we received the flowers for the day  the bouquets were gorgeous  they were purple and white rose buds and crystals and beads and they all came in individual glass vases  also in another box was to buttoneers and a corsage  after that the bride and her girls arrived and my first husband too  the girls were hungry and since the brides dad had not got his room we had a large tray of lunch meat and buns to snack on  so the photographer came and then we were in gear  everyone was getting dressed and pictures were taken  once the photographer left  we got the call that the bus was waiting for us  we got in the bus and made our way to the mackenzie hall  it was so lovely  the honey floors were in a golden hue with a violinist playing in the corner the hall was a hum with very eager and excitable people all seated waiting for the ceremony to begin  we were all in the back area doing our last minute touches   and bathroom break  then all of a sudden the moh fiance was waiting to escort me and hubby down the aisle  it was like riding on a magic carpet we were whisked down the aisle and the grooms men were standing in a straight row and there was our future son  in law   the groom standing there all nervous  the bridesmaids were one at a time walking down the aisle and then it was the bride  she was beaming with joy  the groom went from a nervous man to a smile that came across ear to ear  as she came steps closer to him he beamed and a twinkle in his eye was stronger and stronger  the ceremony was a blur  i hear the vows the two exchanged and i saw the register being signed  and then the announcement of the mr and mrs was made and with that my oldest baby  my daughter whom i had big dreams and aspirations for  was walking down the aisle away from her mom and dad and dad and sister ans was walking away with her husband  and i was happy  my dreams for her were met and then some  she has grown into a smart  educated  well travelled  well mannered and extremely happy young woman and i have no complaints at all  she has a great future and i can sit back and enjoy the view  now back to my story  we were quickly whisked away for a couple of pictures i wish i had spent more time there  it was still a blurr and i was hoping for a couple of together pics  now hubby and i headed back to the hotel  since we rode on the bus we had to hop a ride back  we ordered some room service and floor hopped till the reception  well the bus came back with the bridal party and there were a few touch ups and off to the reception  now we stood for about an hour and greeted all the guests  we then were introduced to the hall  hubby and i pushed our imaginary shopping carts into the hall then we did the imaginary water sprinklers and off to our seats  moh came in and had the best man piggy back ride her the whole wedding party was on the dance floor and the   large picture windows were closed  once the bride and groom were starting their first dance  the curtain went up and the light up skyline was breathtaking  then we had dinner and in between the courses jane and john the emcees  kept the evening going  the best man and sisters of the groom and moh and parents all had funny and touching speeches  it was a wonderful meal and the dancing the night away was over the top  since it was new years eve there was hats and beads and whistles and then blow up guitars and saxophone and microphones and shoes even a limbo game was a hit  it was a fun night and long  long remembered  just glad the only issue i had was three sprained toes drunk dancing lol   on leaving the warmth of my car it seemed a very wise idea to have put on my  very manly  tights for this event  it was just over freezing and the marshals told me that the route was very icy  i also had a long sleeved top under my club vest  gloves and ridiculous looking ear warmer band thing  other runners had different ideas  ranging from shorts and vest to coats and woolly hats  about half the field were in that hideous lurid day glo colour of yeovil town road running club  and most of the others had one or more items of a similar colour  presumably in homage to the host club   i was resplendent in silver maiden newton runners vest  anne says its grey   coordinated with blue and orange top  red and black tights and yellow and blue shoes  im lucky to have a capsular wardrobe  john and jane eschewed maiden newton colours in favour of some other club with far more gaudy vests  they seemed very keen  starting their warm up    minutes before the start   until i spoilt their fun by telling them that the race started at     not       as they had presumed  nevertheless  john had to make last minute adjustments to his laces which made him the last runner to the start  john was off like a rocket at the start  and i did not try to keep up  a few minutes in i was at the back of a fairly large pack and was opening up quite a gap on the group behind     minutes in  jake caught up and overtook me  of the famous running combo jake  carol  and sometimes their dog   sorry guys cant remember your surname  he was looking strong  but i managed to wear him out with the occasional witty comment and was pleased to see that he could no longer endure my company and started walking when we got to the hill  the hill was challenging   i thought it was slippy but was corrected by a runner from frome  who corrected my bad grammar and told me that it is slippery  unfortunately the know it all failed to slip over and charged past into the distance   must have had a very strong finish as he was out of sight within a few minutes  hope hes not reading this  or my punctuation will no doubt be found wanting     i overtook jake  put a bit of distance between us by throwing myself down the other side of the hill  and just managed to stay ahead of him to the finish  i think he may have slowed down to wait for carol  who was in front anyway  i think   but whatever the excuse it was nice to finish ahead of someone who normally beats me  marvellous michael normally finishes just ahead of me  but today he was well ahead  seems to be on good form  martin chaffey and i often find ourselves battling around the middle of this sort of run but he had his hands full  literally  with family responsibilities and was not running  it was a great route   fast and flat out  then to mud   ice  then up and down a hill and back  a gigantic medallion and warm soup to all finishers  and i made good use of the showers and changing rooms  all very civilised  i recommend the race  and look forward to having a go again next year  time about an hour and   minutes    fe   ed ee  b   b efad sometimes work can be extremely boring  like this morning when we were slow  and then sometimes it can be very eventful  as was this afternoon    so this man and woman come to the teller window next to me wanting to deposit an insurance check that is made out to both of them  jane  the teller  asks them if they have an account together with us  and the woman says  he opened an account here when he started having an affiar   and she glares at him  the guy starts cussing at her and tells her to shut the f up or hes gonna whoop her  she says   whoop me in front of all these people   and seems to just be egging him on  he says hell take her outside and whoop her and continues to grumble about beating her a and she better stop talking  so jane says she will have to get an approval on the check and will be right back  they are still arguing when she walks off  the guy says   if you dont shutup im just gonna walk out   and the lady says something like   you already walked out once     jane gets back and tells them the check will have to go on a hold  and they decided to take it and leave  well the lady tells us before she leaves   dont ever get married  even the ugly ones have affairs   and he was right there  within ear shot  she walked off and just winked at us  ha ha ha ha ha     we started cracking up when they were gone  i said it was like watching a play  it was so funny and very entertaining  hilarious  this last week i was exploring the familysearch learning center area to see what was new  i randomly choose a video to check it out  it turned out to be bob teaching   now i cant zero back on it   in the middle of the video he was talking about using facebook as a research tool  i listened as he talked about finding a family group on facebook  on which he found pictures and information  i considered this and decided it was time to set up our  family facebook to find those branches that have not yet been found  i contacted a distant cousin and told him what i was up to  he thought it was a great idea and supported the idea  i set it up and added pictures  links to blog posts  then invited some cousins and told john to invite his family  it was set up as an open group and once i had it formated and set up i told the members it was their page to share  search  and grab pictures  i was wonderful to see it went from   to    members in two days  most are   and   th generation that i am just now meeting  it is so fun to see the meet and greet and explanations going on in the chat  now  i know you are thinking what does that have to do with the hero  about       i was beginning to realize the importance of have proofs on information i had in our family history we were gathering  i asked if we could go to pawnee  oklahoma and see if we could find my great grandmothers grave  and if we could maybe go to the court house  he said maybe  he would have to see if he could take a couple of days off during the week  it was okayed and we began out journey  we first went to my aunt annes to found out where the gravesite was  she mentioned she had heard from my cousin jane in kansas  my heart went zing  i had not seen jane since my one of my other aunts had died in       i looked longingly at the hero and said could we call her and maybe see her that slow smile came over his face and he said sure  what is the number  we called and it just so happened that she was off and so was her husband could we wait they could be down in an hour  when they arrived  we began sharing what had happened in the last    years   yes  that is way too long  after about and hour  there was an ahem   i looked at the hero and he said we need to go to the court house if we are going to make it on time  he looked at my cousin and her husband and said  do you all want to come too yes  we all piled into the car went to the court house  they actually had the death certificate for my gr gr grandmother sarah jane   we got two copies one for me and one for jane  we saw that the funeral home listed was just across the street  so we went there  they gave us the burial plot and a map  we then when out to the graveyard and found the gravesite  the hero managed to help us  connect with each other  obtain a death certificate and gravesite information as well as a visit to the grave yard all in   hours in one day  with the heros help this was the beginning of a special bond my cousin and i still share today  we both remember that day well  many of those reconnecting on facebook are neices  siblings  and nephews of jane  i love the hero so much for taking time out of his busy work life to help me find my family living and dead  he was a family man  february was the month of birthdays  the month got started with a birthday celebration for the twins  and what gift could be better than a trip to see the greatest birthday parade and all your love able friends yup  thats right  disneyland grandma  flew out to california to join us in our adventures  the trip started with a much anticipated but never duplicated dinner at rainforest cafe   well  at least we will not do it again the kids loved it  its a one time place at best  its was overpriced and crowded  we are glad we are no longer curious about it  the next day the kids arrived early to get their birthday badges and pictures with some fun friends  mickey was a must  we had a great time  the food was fun  and the lines were short  we literally walked onto the busiest rides  pirates  haunted mansion  splash mt  teacups etc   without fast passes  the longest ride we waited for was peterpan     min  the new parade soundsation was fantastic  i must admit i have a crush on rupunzel  she was my favorite in the parade  they also brought back a classic featuring mary poppins and bert riding carousel horseslove love love  the best part of the whole day was that during the parade each character specifically wished john and jake a happy birthday  it kinda surprised us when we heard ariel yelled down from her seashell  happy birthday john   and blew him a kiss  we had front row seats on main street and all the princesses and peter pan each said happy birthday to them  i would highly recommend not underestimating the power of the birthday button  it was a great day to be at disneyland next came mommys birthday  not much to say here  another year older  hopefully wiser too  it came  it went  then we had bobs birthday  sweet bob  he is the busiest little guy  we adore him  he knows it  he refuses to walk because everyone is always carrying him around  he also refuses to sleep through the night because he knows mommys a wimp  thus  we are always tired  but never tired of his smiles and hugs  at   year he has   teeth  and is    lbs  he loves to wave and clap  he is very curious about lights and points to every light  he loves looking at the moon with daddy  he is such a blessing  life wouldnt be the same without our little man  we love you  bob  anne  joe and cousin jack joined us for birthday dinner  along with uncle david and his   kiddos  we had a great time  we spent the next day lounging at the pool  it was a balmy    degrees  wow  fun memories  im writing this from the bogota airport  waiting for my flight back to santiago  when i last posted  i was about to head off to northern colombia to cartagena  so  how was it i split the   days between cartagena and santa marta  a fishing town about   hours away by bus   but it didnt really matter where i would have spent my time  the sickness came back with a vengeance  so most of my time was spent in each of the hostels i stayed at  luckily one of the hostels was really good about taking care of me  it also had a pool on site and everyone was friendly  so at least i could lounge by the pool a bit each day  for me i wasnt sick enough to visit the emergency room or go to a hospital  and so resting up actually worked out well  once i was back in bogota  marcial took me to a pharmacy  and i was able to get some medication   before this my voice was almost nonexistent due to congestion in my throat  pretty i know   so my last few days in bogota i drank lots of tea  enjoyed a cough syrup affectionately called muxol  and watched lots of tv  oh  and i forgot to mention something my stomach apparently didnt want me eating food or taking aspirin  as it would come right back up  so for about   days it was mostly tea  water  and a gatorade here and there  well  at least i was able to drop a few kilos after the foodfest in gringolandia  when i woke up this morning i was pleasantly surprised to find out my voice and throat felt completely back to normal  this was definitely good news  but i was still very low on energy since i hadnt been eating  i decided to stay on the safe side and stay in my stomach accepted my offering of bran cereal with some milk for breakfast without too much of a fuss  the trip to the airport wasnt too eventful  after calling a taxi service and waiting on hold for over   minutes  i had the bright idea of hailing a taxi from the street  it turns out that thats not easy to do as rush hour begins in bogota  the doormen helped me out  and luckily after about    minutes i was able to flag one down  where the good health during vacation gods werent looking favorably on me for this trip  the baggage limit gods sure did  once i put my first bag on the scale  the woman at the counter asked me what the weight limits were  i confidently told her it was    kg  about    lbs  per bag  she told me that it was actually a combined weight of    kg  about    lbs   she asked how long i was planning on being in santiago  and i told her about living there and how with my trip to the states and then here i didnt keep good track of the change in baggage allowances once i got into south america her colleague went to talk to a supervisor  and they decided not to charge me for my baggage  i thanked them graciously and made my way through security and to my gate  so  what in the end causes my sickness marcial suggested at first that it was altitude sickness  but my symptoms werent anything like those i had before  and they persisted even when i wasnt at a high altitude in cartagena and santa marta  then he suggested that i got some type of tropical fever  i find that also doubtful  as i didnt spend any time going to luaus  drinking fruity drinks from pineapples  hanging out under a cabana on the beach  or any other tropical like activities  im not quite sure what it was  but im glad it has passed  im just very grateful that i am able to return to santiago and can continue my life there  well  we are going to board in a few minutes  signing off  so this has been a crazy trip already  we left yesterday morning  everything was on time and we made it to houston without any problems  we spent a good chunk of time there  then boarded a flight to miami which ultimately arrived late well  the gate was occupied whenever our plane pulled in  so we had to wait for about    minutes  and were expecting that the flight to recife would be a little delayed since there were quite a few people on our plane also going there  we were wrong  we made it to the gate with about    minutes to spare  after running through the airport  and the jerk lady at the gate said we couldnt board the flight because shes a big stinky turd   well  not really  so basically  we missed the flight to brazil  some tears ensued ultimately  we booked a new flight to sao paulo that left last night around midnight   then we got there around   oclock in the morning  waited around until   pm  and explored the sao paulo airport for awhile   then flew   hours to recife   the people i sat next to on the plane were really nice   honestly  the brazilian flight was the best   it was short  there werent people alllll up in my business  there was a guy on the flight to miami who was practically on top of me   and the flight attendants were all attractive and gave us candies  d heheh  its been fun trying to use my portuguese too  so  we landed in recife  went out the gate  and were greeted by none other than caio and his mom    it was so nice  but driving in brazil is literally hell  there are so many cyclists and pedestrians weaving through cars  nobody stays in their lane  and mehh  the drive from recife to joao pessoa was not the best  but yup  were here in our little hotel room  i think were going to walk around to try to find a bite to eat  then tomorrow morning im going running and to caios university                                                    frogs  that is yes  im talking about the little green jumping animals    from now on you can officially call me crazy   an officially crazy frog rescuer  because for about two hours i was lying flat on the garden ground  hanging head first in a small  more than one meter deep hole  trying to save these    frogs out of that said hole  my neighbours for sure think i lost my mind   but i dont care       we had totally forgotten about that hole  it was overgrown with grass and ivy in a rarely used part of the garden   my parents once collected rainwater in it  many years ago   yesterday my mother remembered it  and decided to cover it with a big steel plate   before doing so  i checked the hole for animals   our gardens are habitats for many lifeforms   and holes are mean traps for animals   well  the hole was filled with frogs  small ones  big ones  all alive and kicking but not able to jump out  so i spent almost two hours lying in the dirt and catching the frogs  i needed some tricks  because my arms were too short and i couldnt reach the ground of the hole  i used peaces of wood to lure them higher up and i even talked to them   i talked to frogs  o o  long story short   i grabbed them all  brought them into another part of the garden and theyre fine and save  is proud the hole is covered with a big plate now   and my neck hurts like hell   but it was worth it       this isnt one of the frogs i saved today  but an inhabitant of my garden  did i mention  that i like frogs    on monday morning myself and anne headed down to tsujiki fish market for the early morning auction  tsujiki is the largest fish market in asia according to lonely planet  maybe even the world  the market area covers several kilometres  we got there at     am and missed the auction as nothing was signposted in romanji but we werent the only ones  we bumped into plenty of other people  many there earlier than us  and none had managed to get to see the auction itself  according to one guidebook the auction is only open to the trade   anyway it was still a fantastic experience to see hundreds of wholesalers ferrying their wares back and forth including some huge tuna  the small delivery carts speed around fully loaded and i saw a few collisions so i guess it make sense to stay out of their way  the tuna had their tails cut off and stuffed into their mouths to save space in such cramped conditions  i took plenty of photos and peered into lots of boxes of marine produce many of which id never seen before  i watched traders scoop live fish out of water tanks onto iced displays  toss live crabs and lobsters accross stalls  skin and prepare eels for pickling and plenty more   after the wholesale market we wandered around the smaller peripheral market which sold everything from marine equipment to vegetables and specialist teas  there was also stalls where you could get the freshest noodles and sushi in tokyo   straight of the boat  people were queueing to get in at     am in the morning  i thought about having a sushi breakfast and then decided my tummy might not thank me for it and opted for a roadside cappucino and pastry instead   on the way back to the subway station we went in to a beautiful buddhist temple right beside the hibaya line entrance  it was quite different to many japanese temples in that the altar area was very elaborately decorated  it was nice to take a breather there before jumping on the subway home  we did indeed have sushi for breakfast yesterday after an early start at the tsujiki fish market   quite possibly the freshest sushi ive ever had and fantastic  as long as we didnt think too much about the possibility that wed eyed the very same slab of tuna over its last breath an hour before at the market   you might be questioning our sanity waking up before   on our first full day in tokyo to trek across town and see blocks worth of raw fish  but it was totally worth it  in spite of the initial shock   we saw severed tuna heads larger than mine  freshly chopped   fish so fresh it was still flopping  that was hard to watch    tubs of squirmy eels  two foot long inky squid  and crabs  still alive  but already breaded for their eventual death by flash frying   rarely do i come that close to my food in its natural state   fortunately  after the first few minutes  we adjusted to the madness and grew to appreciate its wares   im not sure the stone faced vendors appreciated us getting in their way and snapping a plethora of pics  however but thats okay   i promise the pics are worth it   afterward  we ate sashimi  sushi  and miso soup with a shrimp plopped in it  eyes still attached  which meant several of us refused to eat it    eyes are hard to handle    i just closed mine and took a sip  and it was great as long as the shrimp and i avoided eye contact   as jane said  hes in a hot tub   have to run for now to check out of the hotel  but when i get back  more on ginza and its infinite pastries  bento boxes  and the rice bowl head dog  lots more on him  actually   last night  while loading some firewood into our shed  something hopped around the grass at my feet  i immediately suspected a moth  or perhaps injured dragonfly  but i was surprised to find a wood frog  alaskas only ectothermic tetrapod  i grabbed the little amphibian and ran into the house  i put a bunch of my geckos unused rocks in the cricket tank  there were no crickets   then filled the tank partially with water  then in went the frog  it sat  barely moving  on one of the larger rocks before realizing that water was near  the frog scuried into the water and proceeded to float  catsby realized that something was up and started meowing incesently   i wanted to keep the frog  because during the winter  theres a good chance these frogs could die  they freeze themselves for two weeks at a time  but i felt sorry for the little guy  anne reminded me that hed probably rather be outside with his froggy friends  a point i conceded  so i let him go in our flower garden  i made anne promise that if we found a frog in late september  shed have to let me keep it  id like to help at least one frog get through the freezing winters  there are now some frogs in our backyard   it started with a wasp   jill found a wasp on the window at the farm  she yelled loudly for daddy to come and take it away  so we found a large jar  placed it over the wasp  slid a piece of paper between the jar and the window  and then pulled jar and paper  with wasp inside  away from the window   we took it to the back steps to let it go   for a while  it just clung to the inside of the jar  jill tapped the jar firmly  the wasp flew away   see  thats how you do it  you tap it she instructed   we watched the wasp fly high into the sky   then   oops    daddy dropped the jar onto the step  it smashed into lots of pieces   together we started picking up the pieces  being careful not to cut ourselves   i pulled back some grass next to the step  and there was a little frog   jill was ecstatic  look  a frog  a frog  she cried  can we keep it  daddy  we looked for something to put the frog in  we found a plastic container  we put some holes in the lid so the frog could breath  then some rocks and grass and bark and water inside  then we put the frog in   it jumped right out   we caught it again and put it back  and closed the lid   can we catch some more frogs  we found another couple of frogs by the back step  so now there were three frogs in the container  and the back step area was frogless   can we go look for some more frogs  daddy  we looked around the house area  but couldnt find any  but jills frog hunting passion was not to be denied  we decided to walk down to the dam in the steep gully below the house   we walked around the dam  looking in the grass at the waters edge  no frogs  but we did find lots of slimy looking frog spawn  with tiny little tadpoles inside   luckily it didnt occur to jill to try to pick up and keep some frog spawn   we went back to the house   by this time  one of the poor frogs had been crushed by a sliding rock inside their container home  we fished it out   im going to let the frogs go tomorrow she announced   later   daddy  can take the frogs home and let them go there  that seemed an ok idea  i was outside with my two youngest  when i looked down by my feet and saw a frog next to my foot  the girls came running over to see it and the next thing i knew we were crouching in the grass  watching it make a slow trek across the yard in the fading light  we all thought it was headed towards the pond  where the frogs have been laying eggs like gangbusters the last week  at the last minute she faked us out  hopping underneath our porch instead  we all hopped on the trampoline like frogs until it was really  truly dark outside  we went to the conservation here in town on the   th and we all had such a good time   john and i even went down the hill too   bob loved sledding and while sliding down the hill he would giggle and yell out his happiest word coooookie  all the way down the hill        jake also enjoyed sledding but his favorite thing to do in the snow is to have snowball fights      jake also had fun teaching bob the joys of eating snow    and both boys enjoyed attacking daddy at the bottom of the hill    then  once jake was tired of walking back up the hill  he decided to help push daddy and bob down for one last ride    when john was bringing bob back up the hill i asked if he had fun   in true bob style he replied no with a huge smile and giggle  he answers no to everything lately   even if the real answer is yes   so they we asked if he wanted to go again and he said no  of course  but as soon as john put him and the sled down bob crawled back in  read to go again lol  it was about time to go home and john told me i had to go down the hill at least once  i had been running up and down the hill getting pictures of course   so jake offered to push me and when i was about to go down the hill  i grabbed him and pulled him along   he was laughing the whole way  but was not happy when we got to the bottom and he thought hed have to walk all the way back up  so  since it was my fault he was down there again i carried him and the sled back up oh my was that a work out    we got home and took off our coats  hats and boots   and john snapped this cute picture of all our boots sitting on the rug to dry north carolina finally saw some snow today   i woke up at     this morning and it was pouring down at our house    it snowed most of the morning and we ended up with about         of the white stuff   me  i do not drive in this stuff   call me a chicken but i dont trust myself  and i really dont trust the other idiot drivers out there that could plow into me   i especially dont like the idea of anne being in the car with a wintry mix falling either   so anne and i stayed home today  i had brought my budgets home with me just in case   but first we had to get some playtime in   we headed out around  am this morning with our neighbors and their kids for some fun   we both have yards and driveways that are downhill  and not to mention a can of baking spray to add to the fun    i really wasnt sure how anne was going to like being outside with it so cold and i thought she would be afraid of sledding   boy was i wrong   we stayed outside for about an hour and she went in kicking and screaming   joey got to play for a little bit before he went to work which im sure brightened his day   hopefully well get to see more snow before the winters over  but judging from the past couple of winters  its unlikely   but maybe god will surprise me    make sure to check out the pics of flickr  dear gentle readers   im stuck inside for nearly the second day in a row due to snow  lots and lots of snow  according to news reports  about a foot of snow was dumped onto roadways and streets in town yesterday   thank goodness im drinking some hot cocoa and nibbling on some sugar free chocolate chip girl scout cookies while watching this stuff   when i was a child  i yearned for snow days to escape the humdrum and loneliness of school  whenever school was canceled  my brother and i got out our sledding circles  i was too big for those normal sized sleds  so we got those large plastic disks instead  and launched ourselves into a sledding frenzy for a good hour or so  i used to grab handfuls of glistening white snow and eat it straight up  sometimes hauling a bucket or two inside to make snow ice cream with milk and sugar before it turned into slush   today  i probably wouldnt allow my kids to make snow ice cream  afraid that the atmospheric toxins would damage their immune systems  i may let them  however  still go sledding around the neighborhood  taking them away temporarily from the playstation and the tv  kids still need inventive play outside  even in the snow   later  folks  last week i felt so ready   i made six wreaths  baked four pies and made hors deaurves for a party we attended   the kids and i did some shopping  gift basket items were purchased for our employees  for the family of two teens who basically raise themselves and their younger brother  we bought pajamas and robes  clothing and gift cards  and for the single mother and her toddler son who just moved out of the homeless shelter into their own apartment the kids and i purchased and delivered a christmas tree and all of the trimmings  for the little girl on our street who is positively the most gracious child one will ever meet  we have done a secret santa type    days of christmas advent  leaving a small gift for her to find on her doorstep each morning   it has been such fun   i love that my children pour out their hearts this time of year  are very willing participants in gathering  wrapping and delivering these gifts for others  they come to me separately and together and say  i just thought of a great idea for so and so   and  i can help deliver saturday afternoon at     this is life with older kids  parents are penciled into their busy schedules   each of them has whole heartedly participated in the true spirit of christmas  im so proud   today it dawned on me that they also deserve a present or two under the christmas tree in exactly   days   presents erhm  tree oh yeah i have the most amazing friends  one of them just gave me a little christmas tree about a    inches tall  roughly     cm  for err christmas   its the first christmas tree ive ever had  my parents being the practical people they are  they never saw the point of putting up and decorating a christmas tree  in fact  they dont even believe in giving presents  thats right  i never had christmas presents  i was a deprived child     anyway  this year i was looking wistfully at christmas trees    theyre out in full force everywhere  it seems    and thought of getting a small one  but my budget is rather tight and in the end i decided not to  coz id have to dismantle it and put it away after christmas is over  and im not sure that i would actually ever get down to doing that  but in the end my friend gave me one    i dont know why i suddenly wanted a christmas tree  maybe it had something to do with the fact that im having extra difficulties getting into the  christmas spirit  this year and i thought it might help to have something pretty and glittery to look at  shrugs i love christmas carols  but the season itself never inspires me and i always feel rather indifferent towards it  this year has been worse for obvious reasons  obvious to whomever has been reading my blog lately  anyway    well  i have a little christmas tree now  im so delighted you cannot imagine   ese     d  d eeef         c i hope im not turning in to one of those people who are unemployed in the us  pf changs really messed up my training  it was one person really  if you wouldve seen this schedule i got you would understand  some of you did see it so you know what i mean  i went in last wednesday to take what i thought was my final training class  i was told i missed it and it was the day before  i was really confused becasue my schedule said i was off that day so i pulled it out and showed them  then she says thats not your schedule  i was like its not what do you mean she said i wrote you a new one and gave it to someone to give to you  i said i never got it  who did you give it too she didnt know  she said it was posted online also on the schedule website  i said no it wasnt cause i was just on that this morning  she looked and sure enough i was right  she said well now i need to talk to my boss and see if there are any training hours left for you  i said there has to be i didnt use them  she wouldnt even let me follow someone around again that night  so i had to go home with the fact that she said she would be calling me by the end of the week  did she call no  so i will call on monday morning  i dont know if i even want to go back now  she is the server manager and id have to deal with her all the time then  so this weekend i proceeded to apply for some jobs online  hopefully tomororw i will hear back from someone  this sunday bob and i leave for disney  i could wait to apply for more until come back from that  when i come back i have lots of stuff at tdt going on  theres some income  does anyone know of any places who are hiring part time or full it doesnt matter  one snowy afternoon when i was all bored and lonely i decided to call jake  jake asked what i was doing  i then answered with a bored statement  i told him that i was bored and that we should go play in the snow  he came  and we went   the first stop was his house to get rope to make handles for the snow pans  we got them all ready to go  then  after that  we went straight to our football field hill and panned down it going faster then the speed of light  well  not really  but we went pretty fast   next we went to the top of hill where the buses meet to pick up the elementary students and looked at sledding down the backside of the hill which down to the pool  i went down because i am crazy anne  jake didnt want to  i went down and wrecked as i went flying down the hill  it kinda hurt  but i was ok   finally  we went to our big m for mapleton   its on a big hill behind the school   we tried going down some hills but failed  it all together was a good fun time in the snow  every year we wait half in anticipation  half in dread for the first day of snow  for some  it signals the true start of winter  to others it marks the nearing of finals week  for me  it marks the time for boots and gloves  scarves and hats  it also marks the time for sledding  skiing  and ice skating  the first day of winter is a huge event  especially for those who are in south dakota  it is impossible to escape the snow if youre living in sd  for me  this year i was working when it was snowing  i was so sad because i was unable to go out and play in it like i have done ever since i was a child  fortunately work ended shortly after that and i was able to call up my friends and head to their place  once there we bundled up in our warmest clothes that we hadnt really had a chance to use yet  out came scarves of many different colors  hats  mittens  gloves  winter coats  and boots  finally  we were prepared and we dove outside  it was great to play in the snow like that  its something ive done with my friends for years and i hope to be able to continue doing  afterwards  wet and cold and sniffly  we headed inside and warmed ourselves with hot chocolate  the first day of snow is a very important cultural event for this area  i hope everyone survived the snow   with the early school dismissal on friday  it felt like a   day weekend  with the kids indoors for most of it  it felt like a   day weekend  my kids are just not creatures of winter   i did manage to take them and some of the neighborhood kids out sledding on friday and saturday  that was a blast  friday  because it was in the teeth of the storm  and i just could not pass that up  the kids were shivering in the shelter after    minutes while i was howling at the storm  literally  and sledding myself   saturday was nicer  once the snow let up  and we tried again  the hill that had us and   people friday  now had at least      i stopped counting at      with more coming in   the kids had more fun  and i had a fire in the shelter with a bag of marshmallows and just enjoying myself  followed up  of course  with hot chocolate at home  everyone sugared up but happy   i even managed to cook cornbread from scratch  in an old  my grandmothers  cast iron skillet  with chicken and gravy for dinner  if i had any collard greens  i think i would have cooked them too  just to annoy the kids   it was the first time i made cornbread that way  usually it is from full or partial mixes  i surprised myself when i found that i had both baking power and baking soda on hand   when the hell did i buy those  sunday was slow   i racked some mead and then it was pretty much the kids with computer and gameboy games all day   i am going to try tonight to make another batch of mead  raspberry  i found a gallon of puree in the basement   less than   months until starwood  so i dont know if it will be ready on time  the other stuff will be  but that only gives me about   gallons  my family has many traditions and little things we do to celebrate the holidays   esspecially christmas time   it all starts when we pack the whole family in the car and drive up to a christmas tree farm and everyone walks around and picks a tree and we chop down the best one   we tie it down to the roof and go get hot chocolate and sit around the fire pit and talk and have a good time   when we get home we bring it in and set it up in the stand and begin to decorate it   we put ornaments all over with lights and tinsel   my mom sets up a little village under the tree and then we turn the ligthts on and admire the hard work we just did   when i was little we had a big like   foot book of the night before christmas and my parents would read it to me and my sisters and than send us off to bed so santa could come but we dont do this anymore   on christmas day we wake up and open presents   then the rest of my family comes over and we open more presents and this is all followed by a huge feast    i cant wait for all the food on christmas day   also i look forward to spending time and talking to my family because it is something we dont really have time to just sit down and do alot of the time  yay christmas  its probably my favorite holiday of the year  even with the shadows of last years christmas break  its still such a happy time of year  this year was pretty good  though  minus assorted family drama  christmas eve  we went to our cousins place in ashville  had dinner  talked  etc  i discovered a taste for lord calvert  as well  after that  we went to midnight mass  we got back around      went to bed around    and due to my ridiculously infallible internal christmas clock  woke up at    i got a lot of stuff i wanted  along with some other cool stuff  my parents got me a creative zen  which is awesome  ive already got it loaded up and ready for me to not pay attention in class     i also got season   of both sealab and samurai jack  so thats awesome  my one sister got me a red lobster gift card  which brings the total to      and my other made me pajama pants  which are ridiculously comfortable  i also got a bunch of candy and assorted other cool things  all in all  it was a very enjoyable christmas   im looking forward to the rest of break as well  im still not sure whats going on for new years though  but im sure ill figure out something  ill hopefully be back up in rochester either the  rd or  th  well see   i like being happy  its such a nice feeling  due to the extremely mild weather on monday  my parents decided that they should open the windows to air out the house  this was a problem  however  because our kitchen windows do not have screens  which  consequently  allows outside creatures to enter  needless to say  tuesday morning  my mom found a bird frantically flying around the kitchen  where this bird was hiding all night is still a mystery   however  my dad was able to guide the bird toward the door and shortly thereafter  the bird flew back into the wildor so we thought  tuesday night we come home from dinner  and no sooner had i walked in the house and turned on the light  i saw a bird fly into our christmas tree  there had not been just   bird  but   that had entered the house  and unfortunately  the friend of bird   had not been lucky enough to escape earlier in the day and passed the time by nestling atop our    foot christmas tree  it took us forever to rid ourselves of this creaturethe stupid thing kept regressing back to the highest part of our tree  which of course was unreachable  finally  after disassembling ths tree and devoting almost   hours of our night  bird   was gone  thank goodness  it had been a very long day  and between my dad constructing a homemade net to  catch  the bird  my mom laughing  and my desperate desire to go to bed  i was seriously about   seconds away from totally flipping out  you should have been there  well  it has been long enough  for those of you who keep checking this blog to see if i am over my mcgriddle fetish  i am actually posting again  thanks for coming back   christmas was fabulous  i remember when i was a child and christmas was so magical  i had butterflies in my stomach for the entire month of december  i loved the smell of the fresh pine tree that my mom would coat with so much tinsel that you couldnt tell it was green  i would search for my presents with my sister anytime my parents would leave the house  we actually unwrapped some of our presents that were under the tree and re wrapped them before the folks got home  i loved christmas   as an adult  some of the magic is lost  i worry about getting the christmas cards out on time  all the added responsibilities that go along with the holidays  ie  holiday parties for the kids at school  getting presents for the teachers  baking cookies for the church party  blah  blah  blah  with all of that swirling around in my head it can be hard to really feel the spirit of christmas like i did when i was a kid  i was a little bah  humbuggee until christmas morning  i woke up and got the familiar butterfly feeling in my stomach again  i thought about my children waking up with anticipation to see what santa had brought  i knew what santa had left and i got really excited just to see their faces  it was fantastic  i am truly blessed with a wonderful family  this year was so good to us  we took a family picture on christmas morning just after opening our presents and it gives me that warm butterfly feeling again  i look forward to a fabulous new year in      with tremendous gratitude for my testimony of jesus christ and for the understanding of the importance of family  today i realized how much i actually love her  and no not that crazy chick that i finally got rid of   i was talking on the phone with her and we had run out of things to talk about so i had started singing lips of an angel  shed occasionally sing along but i dont think she was paying much attention to it  but the whole damn song i was picturing her  the lyrics just kept screaming out at me  i mean  not how the song was intended  its really about two people breaking up and the girl calling up her ex and theyre talking about how they still have feelings for each other  but the way i took it in was how her boyfriend doesnt like us talking but she kept talking to me anyways and all these stupid feelings i have for her  i dont even know  im just an idiot  i guess   but it gotten to the point i started crying  i didnt let her know that because i already made things awkward enough in the past and i didnt want to bring it up again   because she only looks at me as a friend and as much as it kills methats all well ever be  this weekend a group of us went on an arcadia excursion to mission beach  it was absolutely amazing  on saturday we got to take a boat out to the great barrier reef  i was so excited to try scuba diving  but seconds after going under the water  i felt claustrophobic and like i couldnt breathe  i couldnt stay under the water  so i had to go back to the boat while the others went diving  but it turned out well anyways  i got to go snorkeling instead  and even got to see a shark and a turtle  thanks to long for pointing them out   there were so many fish with every possible size shape and color imaginable  it looked just like finding nemo  minus the dori fish   i bought an underwater camera and took some pictures and cant wait to develop them once i get back to the states  i saw nemo fishies  rainbow ones  long skinny ones that we think were barracudas  sea anemones  lots and lots of coral  and the most amazingly blue water ive ever seen  it was so gorgeous  some of the people in our group even saw dolphins too swimming alongside the boat  the reef was definitely one of the most incredible things ive ever seen  on sunday we headed out to the rainforest where we went on a tour  our guide was this wonderfully kind woman named denise who talked about all the different kinds of plants and how the aboriginal people used them  we saw huge fan palms  which the indigenous people used in their roofs  hooks they used for fishing  and resilient vines they used for various purposes  including water    there was this one really interesting strangler plant  which starts as a thin vine that wraps around the base of the tree  it slowly grows upwards and outwards  eventually strangling the host tree  the host tree then rots away leaving behind an intricate weave of vine  we also got to swim in a tropical freshwater watering hole which are not usually come by  holy shit  on our dive today  i almost swam headfirst into a black tip shark bigger than me  i dont even own brown swim trunks   i was just trucking along about    feet down  swam over the top of a coral head and there he was  swimming right at me  i just kinda stopped swimming  wondering what to do   as the slight current and my momentum swept me closer to him  luckily  the reef sharks are not aggressive  and he turned and swam in the other direction  trix e and i saw seven more during the dive  and it was kinda creepy when they just swam past us  the barracuda down here are big and ugly  too   the coolest thing we saw was a huge eagle ray swimming along  the water was much clearer today  and i was far more happy than i was on mondays dive   there were a couple of ocean researchers diving with us  doing measurements and fish counts  i chatted with them a little on the boat  and although most people assume that much of the problems with reef systems are due to global warming  these guys were telling me that warm water may cause bleaching  but it is the septic systems here in the keys causing much of the disease found on the coral  they have even demonstrably proven that certain bacteria is behind it and they are pursuing legislation that has been passing in florida and elsewhere   at least its good to know that god is not killing the reefs because he hates gays today i went scuba diving on the great barrier reef awesome doesnt even begin to describe it   not gonna lie  when we first jumped into the water and i started breathing through the mouthpiece  i thought i was going to panic and not be able to do it because it was just that weird  after getting a couple of meters down into the water  i adjusted and was able to focus on the reef instead of how i was breathing   its hands down one of the most amazing experiences of my life  scuba diving in and of itself is a cool experience  but throwing in the reef just made it all that more special  i touched a giant clam and it opened and closed as i sort of petted itthere was this weird plant that changed colours when you touched itits just a wonderful and exotic place with so much activity   some people on my boat after my first dive said they had seen a sharkuhthat may have changed things for me  because i myself hadnt seen a shark  i was able to convince myself to do my second afternoon dive   on the boat ride back to cairns  we also saw a group of whales  aaah  such majestic creatures   im sad i only have less than a week left to explore australia  theres so much more i could do here if i only had time  so this night dive was amzing  we drove down to the beach wich was   mins away  got our gear and set out on the boat  nothing to see at all  we got in the water  and finally i didnt have to think about anyone anymore  just what i would see in this world of beauty  we dove down it was really dark so we had to stay together  we went down about   ms to a wreck boat which just totally blew my mind  there was   parts in total  the front the back and the middle which was in between the two parts just upside down  dont ask how though  we went in through every part every room and just made my week  after that we swam around it and i saw sharks  which was scary but great  pretty friendly little fuckers  just dont do any sudden moves around them  then we dove down a little more and saw an electric eel which seemed like   ft long but things underwater seem bigger since light doesnt travel as fast  after that swam around a small coral reef and saw a big lobster with a school of fish passing by  i wish we could have stayed longer but time was of the essence came back up took of our gear cleaned it and now im home exhausted  it was worth it though    well since now its out there and i know this wont be talked about  well  what now   mhm answer me if you can  i have to go take this salt water off me i decided the easter bunny can stay  the easter chicken needs someone to deliver the baskets  laying all those eggs has to be tiresome  easter was a lot of fun this year  sat  we colored and hid eggs with some cousins  one of my eggs was yellow with a smiley face made by using a white crayon before dying  on my other egg i used a yellow crayon and drew a chick and flower on it then dyed it in blue  it was very pretty  i will have to remember to experiment with different colors next year i helped my dad hide the eggs  i tried to be creative  i hid one egg under my grandmothers plastic chicken  no one found it till i gave bob a clue  i thought it was funny  sunday i got a bag full of treats since jake and i are too old for the baskets themselves  we then went to church  it was very crowded but nice  jake and i almost ended up in a   car pile up on the way over  someone with an atv trailer had suddenly stopped to turn off onto a trail head  they didnt give a warning so us and the   cars ahead of us had very little time to stop  several cars ended up swerving but no one got hit  today i was fingerprinting a guy who was to register as a drug offender  as i was fingerprinting him  he asked me why i smelled so good   i told him i didnt  i told him that i sprayed my uniform with girly perfume to cover up the fact that i had not washed it in       weeks   he told me he liked the way i smelled  then he asked me out   i politely said no   he asked if it was because he is a convicted felon   i politely said no  although thats definetly part of it   i explained that i have a boyfriend  not just any boyfriend  a boyfriend whos mother works for the department as well   he then told me to tell jake he is a  hater   hey jake  hear that im supposed to tell you that you are a hater   he then told me that he would check back from time to time until i became single   ewwwwww  thankskindabut no  so last night i decided my hair needed a little trim  just to cut off some of the split ends to maybe help it grow a little longer  my hair reaches a certain length and then stops growing   since i couldnt reach myself  i asked john for some help  he asked me how much to cut so i showed him a strand and how much i wanted off   just a bit  an inch or so  so he started cutting  after the third snip i realized my head was starting to feel lighter  and thought that was weird since i wasnt losing much hair  didnt really think much else about it  then he was done  and i felt my hair it was short  he cut off six inches  my hair doesnt even go past my shoulders now  i still dont even know why he cut off so much especially since i showed him how much i wanted he said it didnt seem like that much      so much for longer hair  itll probably take a year to get it back to the length it was      i know its just hair but geez i used to occasionally hit up this biker bar on my way home from work  i didnt really fit in at all  but i liked to people watch from time to time  i stopped in one night and although i could very well have gotten my ass kicked  i didnt  and i walked away with this story to tell   it was your typical biker bar  lots of guys wearing leather vests  getting into fights occasionally  drinking bud and doing shots of jack  i dont even remember how this came about  but i ended up picking up a chick one night who lived across the street in the trailer park  she convinced me to bring her home and i parked in front of her trailer  we sat on her picnic table for a little while and were all over each other  she finally invited me inside and i thought i was good to go  as soon as we stepped through the door we were greeted by some guy who was completely naked  he just stood there looking at me and i just about shit my pants  wondering how quickly he could grab a gun which im sure he had  turned out the chick was married and her husband was in the trailer waiting for her to get home  i dont think he realized he was naked  because after about    seconds he finally said oh shit  im as naked as a jaybird and covered up  the girl told him i was a friend of hers and offered to bring her home  i made a quick exit and didnt go back to that bar for a while after that  my ex boyfriend and me broke up about     year ago   weve been very best friends ever since  it almost was like we were still in a relationship  we still met up about every day and he always called me before he went to bed   but we just didnt have sex anymore  during this time i hardly ever hung out with other people and i didnt have any other real friends besides him  last week he told me he had fallen in love with this guy he met a few weeks ago   now he hardly stays in contact with me and it almost feels like he kicked me out of his life  i do want to emphasize that i am over him  ive been with other people since the break up  and i doubt i even still like him as a friend and that i just spend all that time with him because there was no one else  now i just sit at home doing nothing all day  i still have   months of vacation to go  and its driving me crazy  i know i should probably go out and meet people  but ive always been socially challenged  so that is quite hard for me  i dont even know what my question is  i just feel horribly lonely  we gazed up at the sky swimming above us  our flippers hovering in the warm hawaiian ocean  fish flickered below the surface  plummeting off the coral like ribbons  surges of water rocked against the boat spraying drops of water across our tan legs  georgia looked over at me adjusting her snorkel   ready i asked her pulling my t shirt over my head   ready  my sister echoed   we hoisted ourselves off the platform  head first i pumped along the surface  a stream of blue bubbles swam at my heels  a giant coral stretched across the dormant volcano  molokai  crabs creeping in and out of it  to my left a thick forest of reeds glistened with tortoises basking across its surface  i blew through my snorkel and descended downwards  a school of fish raced by my goggles  through the bubbles they created something silver flicked behind school of fish  my ears began to pound as my lungs drained  i glanced up at the surface  rays of white beaming from it  as i beat my arms pushing upward the silver fish brushed the bottom of my feet  at the surface i took a quick breath and dumped the salty water from my snorkel before plunging my face back under the water  hoping for a better glimpse of the large fish   oh god  i swallowed the words and the water as the silver and white shark slithered into the reeds  so i finally mustered the courage to ask a girl out  she is awesome  articulate  bright  sweet and funny  why did i hesitate i guess i was a little intimidated  didnt know how she would respond  honestly  men experience the same butterflies  i also know im not exactly the perfect black chick type  a black guy  lol   so it was all the more daunting  initially i began with a little small talk i could tell she wasnt interested  then i did it  i asked her to coffee  she cracked a smile  as if thinkng about something and then politely declined  now i remembered why i dont ask girls out as often as i should  it was sooo embarrasing  but  do you know what she said she told me she would have  if she didnt have a boyfriend  so thaaaaats why  bummer  maybe i had a chance afterall  who knows maybe she lied i actually saw the guy weeks after i initially asked her out  yup  i finally realized i didnt have a chance in hell with her  life sucks  any advice i really want her  im watching the  polar express  i think its been on tv umpteen times already since thanksgiving  i laugh everytime i see its on just because it makes me think of my little great nephew  who is   this year  last year  he watched the  polar express  for the first time and was absolutely enchanted  he watched it over  and overand overuntil june  i think  i walked into the laundry room one time  and he was standing in there  pulling on a string from a hooded sweatshirt  yelling   whoo woo  whoo whooo   like it was a train whistle  so cute  i tell you   anyway  im thinking about the magic of christmas  when little ones look at the christmas tree lights and think about santa coming to leave presents  and of my children  who are now growing up  i remember when they put out milk and cookies for santa  and reindeer food for rudolph and the others  my daughter  however  wasnt very keen on the thought of santa coming into the house  so she would sleep in her brothers room on christmas eve night   she wasnt keen on the thought of the tooth fairy coming in her room either    ahh  christmas is great for little ones  its getting closer  and   i havent finished my christmas shopping oh shoot  ill be honest i havent hardly started  i got a haircut yesterday and i hate hate hate it  i kind of got it done on impulse  i mean i needed it done anyway  so i wasnt prepared with photos or anything and i had to flip through a magazine looking for what i wanted    i wanted a short version of this basically  like where the top layer curled into my chin  i found similar enough haircuts in a magazine and told her what i wanted   it looked fine wet but it dried completely wrong  she cut it way too short in the front and its basically a shorter version of what i just had which is not what i wanted  because my hair is f thick so short hair is f poofy   and i dunno i just think i look really stupid now  its just completely wrong and i had her layer the back  which by the way  she didnt even do that right   just uuuuuugh i should have just gotten my bangs trimmed or something and idk i want to cry now    and im not even depressed about that  just being on campus for a week has made me feel so f shitty  like shittier than i felt shut up in my room all summer     ps i realized im scared to wear lolita on campus now  awesome y y   where we live in arizona  we hardly ever get rain unless it is monsoon season and then it is little compared to the rest of the state  but we actually got rain last night and a heavy down pour this early afternoon  the kids were having fun playing in the mud puddles and catching frogs of various sizeskids being kids having fun   wet and dirty the boys were outside playing in their underwear having a great old time pushing each other in an old wagon going thru the muddy water  i caught one of the boys trying to smuggle a frog in the house inside his underwear   the underwear looked to full for him to fill out the yard was pretty much a large lake outside when the rain was done and the kids had so much fun  now all we have is mud galore  i have a feeling my white car is no longer going to be white  my son john loves throwing mud at everything and anybodyso watch out  first let me start by saying  i love my husband  i really  really do  if i didnt wouldnt i have married him and i wouldnt want to start a family with him and grow old together and all that good mushy stuff     that however doesnt mean i dont occasionally look at the random hot guy or girl  yep  im like that  but today the gentleman who is going to be doing our pest control came in and i just happened to working downstairs and watching the office for the admin who was out  oh heavens above this man is hot and then he opens his mouth and speaks and hes got this good ol boy country twang which i grew up with and before i met my husband this is the type of guy i dated  only the guys i went out with were never this hot  man  this man is hot and hes one of those guys who doesnt know hes hot  hes just an everyday  regular kind of guy  which makes him even hotter   wow  yeah  he was hot  then i came home and john had dinner ready and it was incredibly good and i thought  yeah  the bug guy is hot  but id never give up what ive got now with john for one night with him  sometimes love does conquer all   anne jake came home on saturday afternoon which was great because that was my   th birthday  i am now     hooray  it feels like this will be a good age   i had fun getting ready for easter with the kids  on friday night we dyed our eggs  i boiled a dozen but a few of them cracked so we ended up with only nine  that was funny because our egg dye kit came with nine colors  so it didnt take us long at all to dye them all   on saturday morning we woke up bright and early to make it down to the town easter egg  hunt   you can see from the picture that it isnt much of a hunt  instead it turns into more of a trample  as kids scramble to get the eggs  some eggs have tickets inside that you can redeem for nice prizes and easter baskets  im usually glad that we dont find those eggs  although we would take one of the bikes  of course   i didnt get a picture of the actual egg gather up because it all happened so fast  and i was pretty concerned about losing my children in the chaos   on sunday afternoon we had our own easter egg hunt at home  it was nice and quite  and the kids kept stopping to open eggs  instead of trying to find them all  but thats okay  it was nice anyway  and we were glad to have jake home with us  just before my boyfriend and i started dating  he had a friend and they both liked eachother and their relationship was going somewhere  but they were never  officially  dating  then i came along and told him that i had a huge crush on him and he basically ditched the other girl for me  he talked to her and tried to stay friends with her  but she was still really hurt  and i can totally understand why  she didnt talk to him for a pretty long time   jump ahead about   months  they started talking and hanging out again  theyre now pretty good friends and they talk and hang out a lot  i wouldnt have a problem with that  except for the fact that im not allowed to meet her  she says if she meets me it will make her too sad  its been almost a year and a half since my boyfriend and i got together  and shes still not over him at all   i really wish i could meet her  its not a jealousy thing  i trust my boyfriend and he always tells me when hes going to spend time with her  and i dont have a problem with it  and i dont want it to be a me my bf and her thing because im sure that would make her uncomfortable  id just like to be able to tag along when my boyfriend goes out with his friends and not have to sit at home by myself because shes going to be there   should i be suspicious should i just get the f over it am i right in wanting to meet her ive recently had the bright idea that i should buy a pair of shears and just cut the boys hair myself  mostly to save some money and also because     of the time when g gets a hair cut  it looks pretty bad anyway  the hen has not yet had his first haircut  but his little wispy strands are covering his eyes and the little mullet in the back isnt doing him any favors  hes basically a ticking  hair  bomb   so en route to costco today  i stopped at the beauty supply store to pick up some shears  i guess i was a little surprised by the fact that they cost      swedish technology and lifetime guarantee notwithstanding  i was hemming and hawing about buying them  but being new to town  i didnt know where else to go  and the time spent researching the matter and gas for driving elsewhere  probably would negate the savings  or so i told myself   it was nap time for the babe and g was playing downstairs with some lentils and bob the builder toys  because thats what all the cool kids are doing these days  can i cut your hair i asked him  before he could reject my request  i proposed a deal ill let you have two popsicles if you let me cut your hair   well he wasnt going to decline two frozen treats  i combed and started cutting  i didnt dare wet his hair  because that always ends in tears  so i cut it dry   the last stylist gave him some sort of weird  across the ears type of hair cut  closely resembling a bowl cut  so i decided to start by the ears and see if i could shape the hair more  or something   im guessing dry hair is harder to cut than wet hair i really dont know  but i was having a hard time cutting all of the hair with one motion  i finished the  first  cut anyway  despite the resistance  until my son started cryingand i realized i was having a hard time  because i was cutting his ear   with my brand new  super sharp  lifetime guaranteed expensive scissors   im not sure which was worse   knowing that id just maimed my boy  or knowing that id somehow have to convince him to let me finish cutting his hair  a bowl cut is one thing  but a random chunk of hair missing around the ear   on one side   one bath  two band aids with neosporin and three popsicles  total   laterhis hair  looks good from far away  if im not wearing my glasses   as j helpfully pointed out  were not really saving money if we have to take him to the hospital to stitch up his ear  im not a picky person  i used to be  about food  but im not anymore  in fact  at this very moment im at the tropical cafe in silver lake eating a sandwich that i ordered only because i thought the name was funny  it tastes good and has a sense of humor  what a charming sandwich  anyway  i got my hair cut today  at super cuts  and it wasnt super  yeah  i know  you get what you pay for at a place like that  but  one time i went to what i will hesitantly call a salon  hesitant because im embarrassed that i went to one  because someone suggested the place and i walked out looking like the bass player from fall out boy  needless to say  the hat went on post haste  that haircut  read hair sculpture  set me back    bucks  so bad haircuts span the payment spectrum  which leads me back to my original statement im not picky  so why cant i get a good haircut  heres what i said to the lady  who was very nice  by the way    i want the same hair cut i have now  but smaller   maybe im being too logical  but to me that says   just cut x inches off of every hair and were good   what she took that to mean was   pick up scissors  close eyes  grab hair chunk  open and close scissors on hair chunk  repeat    times  use hair clippers in some way  any way  open eyes  yell  ta daaa  get fuckin paid   i guess i should have known when i sat down and she immediately started telling me about how she was glad they were busy today because   the more haircuts i give  the more i get paid   but  by then it was too late  im not joking when i say that i could have done a better job  seriously  now  i just want my old hair shape back  even if it was kinda big  im gonna miss it  for at least a couple weeks  maybe more  if anyone in this city knows of a person who can give a haircut that makes sense  tell me abooooot them  if not for the haircut  perhaps for some reassurance that im not a hair snob  after all  for easter i did a ton of fun stuff  on friday i had a sleep over with my cousins  we stayed up until like   in the morning  we had a great time playing and laughing   then on saturday my grandma had an easter egg hunt  she had three different rounds for the different age levels  we each pulled a color out of a hat and then had to find that color in her yard  there was money and candy in the eggs  it was so fun  my aunts  uncles  and cousins who were in other rounds hid the eggs for the other people to find  when i hid eggs i buried them in the dirt and hid them in tubes and under rocks  they had a really hard time finding them  after the hunt we had a barbecue with amazing food  after that we played softball and went to the park  i got really sunburned and hurt my wrist but other than that it was a lot of fun  when we got home from the park we went to my uncles hotel he stayed in and swam in the pool  it was fun  we threw a football around and played games  but mostly talked and laughed  when we were done swimming we went to my aunts house to color eggs  we spilled a bit but it was fun  when we were done with that we went back to my house  some of my cousins slept over and we stayed up really late again  in the morning we ate home made waffles  then we found the eggs the bunny hid that night  we also went through our baskets and saw what kind of candy and clothes we had gotten  i got a lot of candy and plaid shorts with an athletic shirt  then we got ready for church  after that we had corn beef with cabbage  potatoes  and carrots  it was a lot better than i thought it was going to be  cause it didnt look very appetizing  well that is what i did for easter   so i like my best friend a girl   even though she has a boyfriend  i dont like her boyfriend  hes an asshole  im fairly certain he doesnt really like me either  anyways  though  her and him dont always have the best of quality relationship  she went to a family vacation with him the other day and that lasted for a week  and she said that he was acting mean to her most to the time they were gone  we had decided that we should go and see pineapple express when she got back  so the day after she got back  i called her up and we decided to see it the following day today  at about noon  as we were getting off the phone  she mentioned that her boyfriend was pulling into their driveway  after we it was me  her  and one of our friends that went  saw the movie  she said that her boyfriend was kinda mad at her  and that she had tried to get ahold of his cell but couldnt seem to so she called up his house right before she left  woke him up  and told him that she was going to the movies with me  to me  it sounded like she told him that we were going to the movies only after he wouldnt have had a chance to go with us  since she could have told him last night  what do you guys make of this wow  we have a lot of snow  im reminding myself of the hitchhikers guide i state the obvious a lot  so  this large amount of snow ruined all my plans for the past two days i didnt get to visit my grandparents in etown yesterday  or go out to the farm today  or eat lunch with johns parents as i had originally planned  however  my time was not wasted i got to go sledding in cherokee park with anne  jack and bob  who turns out to be a nephew of daves that i had never met before  but happens to work with jack   it was amazing how fast you could get down dog hill on a tiny disc with a running start  it was sleeting a bit when we went  so it was nearly impossible to keep your eyes open to avoid other sledders while going down the hill kinda had to peek every few seconds and pray if you hit someone it wasnt a  yr old  i went back to the park today with joe            and some members of the  family  but instead of sledding i just played a bit in the snow and enjoyed some hot chocolate  ive had such a warm fuzzy feeling the past couple of days    i missed sledding with my bro though  he left to go sledding just as my toes were falling off  so i didnt get a chance to join him  in other accomplishments this weekend  i braved the oncoming snow fri  to make a trip to michaels  where i found a couple of glass vases i was going to rent for     each priced at     so i bought them  triumphantly    also got some silk flowers to use in them that look fabulous  yay  im not looking forward to working tomorrow  but i guess i dont have that much more of this rotation left  so theres a hazy light at the end of the tunnel  was up all night chatting with a mate  it was just freakin awsome   up this night too  chatting with him  hes a really cool guy  just a really awsome guy to talk with  anyhow   my day  just a useless day passing by again  just sitting infront of the computer  doing nothing  waited for my boyfriend to get home from work  so i could talk with him  the day had been sucky again  my dad argued again with me  for not being able to fix the household and stuff  yeah  i was trying to be anonymous  but now you all know im a chick  well  i told my boyfriend all about it and he cheered me up  as usual  then theres this mate i got  who explain his goddamnfeelings for me today  wich really freakin confused me  hes a really good mate  and i dont want to see him get hurt just because i choose my boyfriend over him  well  f   life gets more and more screwed up for each and every day hmmm  i choose to  keep him as a friend and continued talking with him  and he told me deeper and deeper how he felt  f off was all i wanted to write  but i couldnt  didnt want him to get hurt  and i wanted to keep him as a friend  so we talked it through instead  oh well  whatever   i hate this shitty country    theres nothing good about it  another useless day passed by and another one to come  as soon im done with my education im gonna travel the world  and leave this loosercountry    well  ive slept like    hours of     or something  so im not really clear in my mind   damn bets  haha  ive been going out with this guy for almost  years and i really do love him  hes the sweetest guy ive ever meet  but the thing is in  th grade im in   th know  but in  th grade i really liked this guy and he liked me but that spark never left  and i look at him everytime he walks by  im not sure if he likes me i dont think he does  but i told my boyfriend this because its not right to like another guy and have a boyfriend  but the thing is i dont want to like the other guy i just cant help it  i think its an old spark  so i broke up with my boyfriend because i didnt want to put him through this  and he cryed hes like i love you with all my heart and always will  and the last thing he said to me was good bye and i love you  when we did brake up i called him and talked to him  he actually talked to me  and later that day he called me to talk  and he said  why are we even talking what does it mean   and i dont know what to do  i dont know what i want  but my boyfriend and i were already drifting  like for example yesterday was the first time i kissed him in a long time i like the other guy but i dont want to and i told my boyfriend this and he said   i think your mind doesnt want to like him but you heart does   the guy looks at me back but i think its cuz i look at him  thanks for reading  please anwser  so about two weeks ago i left my current ex boyfriend  who was emotionally abusiveive been trying to leav e him for   years now and i finally managed to run to brooks and come live with my sister   so anyways i met this friend of my sisters  mr  x  he was so sweet to me the first week and the next  he said all the right things  held me in his arms well we watched movies   and then we went camping    this is were it all changed  see i started to really care about the guy and i ended up sleeping with him in our friends trailor that night big mistake     now  dont get me wrong im not the type to just have one night stands i believe sex should mean something though  so for watever reason though i tried to justify to myself that after only knowing this guy for two weeks that i should sleep with him   well the next day i have to admit i was overly clingy  literealy begging to stay with him after all our friends went home for the night   i know patheitc ay  then he told me that he had tried to  feel a spark  but there was just nothing there  well thats good and all but just the week before when we were just laying in each others arms watching a movie he was caressing my stomach and he said  im sorry  i just cant stop touching you    now why the f would he have said that if there  wasnt anything there   i know  i know what your thinking  this chick over analysis waaayyyy to much  so now im going to stop ill tell you more later as now im just trying to be mr  xs friends so im posting in the chi town cl because i know that anyone i speak of in this rant will never find it   i got completely trashed for my birthday and asked one of my friends out but he of course didnt take me seriously because i was drunk  i thought he wasnt taking me seriously because he didnt like me  after this conversation with him  i bluntly told another one of my friends that they were my boyfriend and that was that   tonight i found out that my new boyfriend got two phone calls from two of his exs and both of which told him that they thought they were pregnant by him  its not official  but theres a strong possibility  so not only do i have to deal with the baby momma drama with one chick  but now its two  tonight  i also found out that the guy i had actually asked out really did like me and i didnt want to lie to my boyfriend so i told him  then my boyfriend proceeded to flip out on me by yelling at me and calling me a liar  he said i lied about what i said to him the other day which was that i was falling for him and i liked him a lot and i cared about him a lot   my friend feels terrible because he thinks he caused these problems between my boyfriend and i  but he didnt  this is obviously one of those times i should have kept my mouth shut    endrant  i have a group of female friends  and one of the girls  well call her anne  has been dating a guy for a couple months  we went out one night and my friend  well call him john   he didnt previously know any of the girls  came out with us  by the end of the night john and anne ended up going home together  we asked her the next day and she said they kissed  and she never told john she had a boyfriend  we all went out again the next day and we saw them kiss  which means she defiently cheated on her boyfriend  we asked her to tell john that she had a boyfriend  but she refuses to  we think its not really our place to tell john  but john really likes anne  and is getting to the point he is ready to ask her out  do you think we should sit john down and tell him that anne is cheating on her boyfriend with him because we all realise if she is willing to cheat on her boyfriend with john  she will also be willing to cheat on john  ok  so last night i talked to bob as always   a couple days ago he was telling me how this girl was really hot and he asked her out  i asked him what happened and he said that she said yes  liar  bob has an obsession with blondes  i happen to have pretty blonde friends and he always asks me to hook him up with one of them  almost all of them have boyfriends or dont like bob  poor bob  well anyways  i said  wait a minute i thought you were going to go out with that hot chick  turns out she really said no  i laughed  i questioned why he lied to me  he said because of the haha   true i did laugh but did he really need to lie no  he said he knew i would laugh  he knows me all to well  i told him i did get a little jealous by what he said  he said  i know you did   i said how did you know he replied because i know you   the real reason i wont hook any of my friends up with bob isnt that hard to figure out  bob knows i love him  so why would i let him go gallivanting off with one of my pretty blonde big chested friends whats wrong with a smart funny big chested light brown haired girl who knows him better than anyone else nothing hes just a complete moron  its okay its not like im only wasting my time on him  i have a sort of boyfriend that bob completely hates and doesnt trust    jealous much ive really gotten into the christmas spirit  on black friday i purchased christmassy things for the apartment table runner with snowmen and reindeer on it  stockings  a fake tree with lights  im a sell out   ornaments  little red bows to go on the tree  and a few plates to put in the living room  the last time i lived in a place that was decorated for christmas was when my parents were still together and they divorced when i was    wow  thats a long time ago  i cant even remember the last time i had a christmas tree  maybe junior or sophomore year of high school jake is a good excuse to get back into the spirit   he loved decorating the tree  of course there are much more ornaments on the bottom half and along one side   the side thats closest to the couch where he could stand  i redistributed the ornaments which has been pretty useless because everyday he likes to redistribute them himself  its quite cute  and after we were finished decorating  he gave me a big hug and said thank you  awwww  little kids who are not yours are just wonderful   i need to do laundry  i have no socks  in fact  i am currently wearing emilys socks for the third day in a row  gross  they have been stretched out and are now bunched up around my heel  i gotta do something about this   i went to krogers last night on the sole intention of purchasing lemon juice  i left having spent      you see  there were poinsettias  one orange with glitter and then another red  and this really cool flower arrangement  the flower arrangement is pretty thanksgiving ish but i figured they die in a week  and besides  no one gives thanksgiving due attention  everyone always just looks over it to christmas  frankly  it annoys me  also  i feel a bit guilty that i decorated the christmas tree two days after thanksgiving  the flowers are my way of making up for almost overlooking thanksgiving  jake  john  and i all decided to spend an entire weekend hiking and camping in the three ridges wilderness  it took us   days of hiking      miles  with over       feet of elevation gain to realize we bit off more than we could chew  the final miles of the trek was quite possibly the hardest my body has ever worked  we left friday evening and hiked for   hours  to reach the summit of three ridges where we set up camp under the stars  no tent  just us and the sky  keep in mind it was in the   s that night  i can still see john making his bed in the center of a pile of leaves jake made a campfire and we ended up eating two packages worth of brats  all the calories wed need for the next day  we awoke the next morning to glorious sunrise  ate breakfast  and proceeded to break camp to get an early start  saturday was mostly comprised of hiking  where we ran into a maximum of   people on the trail  by the time we got to the shelter on the priest we were exhausted  dehydrated  and hungry  we thought we were dead when we realized the spring we were counting on our water supply  was dried up almost completely  after praying that god would have mercy on us and grant us water  jake stumbled across another spring  not on the map  that was     south of our campsite  praise god for keeping us alive  we ate a hasty meal then crawled into our sleeping bags for an    hour slumber  awaking the next morning  we made the long grueling trek back to where we had started  half the time in the rain  but nonetheless perfect crisp  cool weather for the fall  we all agreed on the way back in the car that  our next outing would be a   mile hike  camping  then hiking back  not to exceed   miles  jane and i went camping friday evening  and so many factors converged into a perfect storm of bliss low humidity  no chance of rain  a multiple mile hike to our chosen campsite through some of the best woods indiana has to offer  without encountering another living human on the entire hike   no bugs  an amazing dog to help carry water and watch for critters  and just enough dry wood to make just enough fire to cuddle by before the sun was completely gone and then just enough moonlight to not trip over each other to walk to our tent free bedding   yes   its just what id been hoping for   the rest of the weekend was full of other bliss inducing stuff  and when i drove home last night  i was wearing a permagrin   this morning  i ebayed a decent tent for the kids and myself  wed borrowed janes for cali   the boys and i have some camping planned during   of their next five weekends with me   my short lived hylophobia is just that short lived  d so this past weekend i went camping at green ridge state park out in western maryland  i went out there to help introduce camping to my friend h   it was car camping  nothing extravagant  but also lots of fun  we got in late on friday night but it wasnt at all frustrating putting up the tent and setting up the first night  the next day we had oatmeal for breakfast and then headed out for a hike  we took our lunch and set off  it was a pretty easy hike  right up until we realized that the trail ended and we had bushwack our way back to our camp  that night we enjoyed a few beers  some burritos  smores and banana boats  on sunday we made scrambled eggs for breakfast and broke camp  it was an enjoyable weekend because the company was awesome and the living was easy  im hoping ill get the chance to go camping one more time next month  well see if it works out  my friend jane and i went up to st agnes skookumchuck hotsprings for a camping trip   this is the first time i have been camping in years   we took the   hour trek starting monday morning  once we got there  we had ample opportunity to pick a sweet ass camping spot  right by the raging lillooet river   after setting up camp  we meet a fellow who stays up there for   months out of the year   he took us for a hike  and showed us these pictographs that we approximately     years old  this is john  our tour guide   our    min hike lasted about   hours  and we bushed bombed some pretty incredible terrain  this is an airplane landing strip just outside of the camping grounds  our gourmet dinner   a cheese and jalapeno smokey with a glass of malbec   yes  i broke my vegetarianism for the weekend  but we were camping  and i havent had a smokey in   years   it was damn good  and surprisingly  my stomach held up well   here is a short clip of a bear we saw on the way into the hot springs   i am trying to upload more videos  but blogger isnt cooperating  so i will try again later  or will post them on my flickr   i sadly have no pictures of the springs   due to hot water  nakedness  and mosquitos  i thought it would be best to leave the camera back in the camp   speaking of mosquitos  i am covered in bites  and just took an antihistamine to stop scratching   all in all  this camping trip was a blast   i got to make a fire  sleep in a tent  hike  get dirty  eat smokeys  and sit in hot springs  cant wait to do it again       a  d eeef     eb e  ive been with my boyfriend for   years  im    and hes     ive been living on my own for the past     years and i like it and all  but it gets lonely  he only sleeps over on his nights off  i moved down here to stay close to him  so we were easily accessible to each other and our relationship could continue to grow  of course  i didnt tell him that  i figured hed just know  he has this thing that if he moves out of his parents house  hes  leaving them  and that nothing will be the same   my relationship with my family is horrible  and i told him it has nothing to do with me moving out  then he tells me my first year living out  that once i finish schooling  get a stable job  and work on our relationship hell consider moving in  he wants a perfect relationship before we move in  and i keep telling him theres no such thing  everyone fights  now he tells me  he has no desire to leave him parents house for the next few years  since everything is paid for  and that when he moves out  he wants it to be out of state  i told him that we should move in together and stay close to his family  since he has such a fear of leaving them  then he tells me  hed like to move a few months before me  so he can live on his own  then have me go out there  i feel hes telling me excuse after excuse   slow and steady win the race  is his motto  and i cant stand it anymore  im not sure what to do  i cant keep having these talks with him without its like me pressuring him  but i want to move forward  please  advice would be so greatful    f a acd eed  dd e eaaa hmm  i am very much in love with my boyfriend and i have been for the past year and   months we have been together  but he cheated on me a few weeks ago  he came out and told me on his own free will and he apologized and said he knows it was a mistake and that it just happened  so i decided to forgive him and we got passed it  but then today  he called me and told me that he just wanted to say hi but couldnt talk very long because he has company  i didnt think anything of it until i thought about when he cheated on me  it was a day like any other day  we talked and everything was cool and he told me he was having a friend over and then i get told   days later that he had sex that night with her  but its not just that  tonight when he got online  he wasnt really talking to me and then he said  to bed  zzzz  and before i could even say  okay  he was gone  usually he says  i love you  goodnight  or something  but nothing tonight  it makes me wonder if he did it again  but i dont want to ask him and make him think i dont trust him and yet if i dont say anything  i will just be left to wonder  will i always wonder when he has a friend over will i ever be able to  truly  trust him again sigh im not sure but i really wish he hadnt done that  i forgave him the first time but im not going to the second  i understand that things happen that you dont plan but when it happens more than once  you obviously  want  them to happen and thats when i dont forgive       d  d ee f  f ec   f    and   by     on  deviant  art    and an update on my life  i am now officially graduated with english   wutt  you think  yes  its true  last year i gave a little self written piece about my gn to my teacher jane  she gave it to an english teacher who is also a fan of buffy  that teacher really liked my story and thought my english was really good  then when this year started i got gitta for english  this morning i asked her if she was the teacher who jane showed me story to  she said she was  and she was surprised that i was the one that wrote it   i also mentioned that in my essay about my life  it was homework  and i wrote   pages   she then said that she loved that little piece that i wrote  then she told me that i dont have to come to her classes anymore  because my english is way above school max  she suggested id better work on something im less good at then learn english that i already know  i mean  for peets sake  we were learning how to use  where  were  and  were  and  to  and  too   as you all notice im pretty good at that  xdd after she told me that she also told me that for the rest of the year im gonna be getting gs for everything  g means good  theres o for onvoldoende bad   v for voldoende acceptable  and g for goed good   she said she could give me vs for everything  but because thatd be unfair im getting gs  she also told me that before this schoolyear started jane had told her that she  gitta  was going to be teaching me english  im so glad i dont have to have english this year  i was bored as hell those   minutes in class  and i was giving all the answers  and no one learns that way  so ill just hide in the cafateria and do calculus or something  xd   f  e  d ee  a  f  f de yes  it seems ive become   that   woman    a few weeks ago here at the beach sis and i got in the elevator with two little girls   they had hit every button in the elevator and it was evident they had been in there a while playing   when we all got off on the ground floor i couldnt help myself so i said something      that elevator has had some issues in the past   i would becareful if i were you because by hitting all those buttons you could get stuck in there and i dont think you would like being stuck in the elevator      the girls looked at me in horror for even speaking to them and im pretty sure they laughed after i walked away but sis and i laughed too   later in the day sis said to dad      red   is the scary lady now   she said something to these kids who hit all the buttons in the elevator      dad laughed but then said    they hit  all  the buttons   and shook his head    well  yesterday i was the mean lady again     the beach condo has this cart   the kind you find at hotels for loading up your stuff and dragging to your room   the residents all chipped in to purchase this for the residents and guests   yesterday as i was coming off the beach i came across one girl on the cart and the other girl pushing it   i walked by and didnt say a thing but after washing the sand off i couldnt help it      you know  that cart isnt real sturdy   i dont think you want to get hurt plus we need that to last at least a little while longer      they nodded in agreement and promptly got off   once i got in the elevator i couldnt help but giggle to myself   i knew sis would get a laugh out of me being the mean lady again        a d ee f  f f a    i admit  i am a slient treatment girl whenever hubby pisses me off   i dont tell him whats wrong  because i expected him to figure it out and apologize   but hes so bad at figuring things out  so by the time he actually noticed something was wrong  ive already forgot what i was angry about to begin with   hubby told me to stop acting like a child and to communicate with him like an adult   i told him i have no idea why i do what i do  but its almost like a reflex  i cant help it     one night while we were driving i shared a little childhood routine with him   i was generally a good kid    some years ago   however  once in a while  i would do something really bad to piss my mom off   she didnt hit me or scold me  she just ignored me for hours until i squeezed out some tears and apologize to her for whatever i did wrong    mmmmmi wonder who else does that these days    hubby questioned   i all of sudden realized the root of my behavoir   i subconciously learned it from my mom   thats how she punished me and i turned it around and used it on my hubby   the only problem is that my hubby is not my child and im not his mother   i cant punish him   lol   now that i know why i do the silent treatment thing  maybe one day i will change   but ted  dont expect me to magically be your perfect wife       f     d ee  a  f    d  on thursday  september    our group met at urec to have our meeting     the picture is of our group out front of urec after we finished working out     when we got out of the gym we decided that we should talk about our epidictic speeches          we first started by telling which topics that we decided to make our speeches about     jane said that she was going to write her speech on blaming lindsay lohan     she feels that lindsay lohan is a bad role model     in her speech  jane is going to compare her early life with her lifestyle that she leads now     jake decided that he was going to praise meditation     he described meditation to have physical  spiritual  and behavioral benefits     ann decided to write her speech on ron clark who is a famous teacher     she chose this topic because ann also wants to be a teacher     ann is going to praise ron clark for all of his accomplishments in the field of teaching     i chose to praise princess diana and her charity work     in this meeting we also discussed some techniques that we were going to use during our speeches     amy was unable to attend this meeting but we contacted her and were able to tell her about what we discussed in our meeting     this turned out to be a very productive meeting     it was nice being able to talk about our speeches and have other people give there opinions on them     by meeting with our group we all felt more confident with our epidictic speeches  so last week  my    year old grandfather fell and cracked his vertebrae   long story short  it was a rough road last week with dr s saying that he was lucky to be alive and today i receive a phone call from my sister saying that his kidneys had failed and that my grandmother and aunts  uncles and father had made the decision to pull his life support  he has been unresponsive a day after it happened     while we live   hours away now   i used to live in the same town as all of my family until i went away to college   every sunday was spent at my grandparents house and i have so many memories of him when i was a kid    but i think the hardest part for me is my thinking of my grandmother and i wonder   how do you do it    how do you say goodbye   how do you kiss your loves lips for the last time and know that you will never be able to do that again   how do you share your whole life with someone go through wars    kids and over    years and then in one moment it is all gone    my prayers are with her because i dont know how she can do this ah  friday  today i made it to my class in up  woke up at  am  stayed in bed for   mins  too tired to get up yet   then finally made a mad dash to the shower and got dressed  water dripping down my hair  i ran down the empty hall and staircase of my apartment building  hailed a cab from the street  then the cab snaked its way to school  cab stopped in front of cal  jumped out  made a mad dash to my  rd floor classroom  had this apologetic look on my face  then i took a seat in front of my professor  to her right  its    am  im    minutes late  i placed my bags down in front of me and saw that my fly open    note to self look  at yourself  before you leap out of the apartment    during class  i think i was sort of a disaster  well  not really  i hope  we were talking about some readings on the invention of traditions and the notions of  primitive and authentic  art in the present perspective  do you know the feeling of formulating what it is you want to say  then you cant wait to say to your classmates then it turned out your explanation was too long and your argument loose  and then people give you a weird stare then they say   ok  anyway     and they move on with what they were previously talking about  argh  paranoid but damn  i think that happened to me    note to self shut your trap    counternote to self please be more prepared for class and be kind to self  this morning  i all got up at   am  to go crabbing and fishing  i left the dock at     am  the kids were so excited  john let anne drive for a while  then jane   i got to my crabbing spot  threw the lines over  and started catching crabs right away  i baited the lines for the kids to fish  anne caught the first fish  a croaker  she was so excited  i caught several crabs  and then they stopped biting  i moved  caught some more crabs  and some fish in the next place  li wanted to keep the fish  and said she would clean and cook them   finally  the crabs stopped biting and iran out of worms  so at   pm i pulled all the lines in  sharon and rich wanted to ride to dewey beach  it was nice there  but i didnt get too close to the shore  i still cant get over how low rehoboth bay is   the kids were tired  and so was i  jane slept on the way back  just today i caught    crabs  and   fish  i probably threw back that many  small ones too  two crabs were dead  so i cooked a total of    crabs  li cleaned and cooked the fish  john  jane  anne  and bob didnt want crabs  so i all ordered some chinese food    i all are exhausted  john sat down after dinner  and went to sleep  bob  li  and the kids went to get ice cream  i had planned on going to wal mart to get sodas  maybe when he wakes up  after waiting what seemed like forever to get into the room  i got to see my little one for the first time in   weeks and wow  what a change  i swooned as soon as i saw the spine and the heartbeat and it just got better and better  all of the measurements are spot on and weighing in at about    ounces then it came to the  money shot  bob and i had been saying for the past two weeks that knowing our child  that it would be difficult and not show the goods  of course  that is what happened for the first tech to see anything  my lo had its feet folded up right by the crotch  like a little frog  finally after tilting me on the table  i got a tiny glimpse but the tech went to get the doctor for her magic touch after twenty seconds under the doctors manipulation   its a girl      i am over the moon  i have been thinking girl since the moment that i found out i was pregnant  bob is happy and its cute he just breaks out in a grin from time to time adorable  his best friend is having a boy on nov    and i just went out to dinner together to celebrate
